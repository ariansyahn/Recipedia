Ingredients:
•	6-8 pack pork sausages
•	1 tbsp olive oil
•	2 onions, finely chopped
•	3 celery sticks, diced
•	2 carrots, diced
•	3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
•	400g can chopped tomatoes

•	175g macaroni
•	410g can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained

Steps:
1.	Snip the ends off the sausages and squeeze out the meat. Roll into rough walnut-sized meatballs. Heat half the oil in a large, wide pan and fry until browned, around 10 mins. Remove from pan and set aside.
2.	Add the rest of the oil to the pan. Tip in the onions, celery and carrots and fry for 10 mins until soft. Add garlic and cook for 1 min more. Tip in the tomatoes and stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 mins.
3.	Stir in the macaroni and return the meatballs. Simmer for about 10 mins until pasta is cooked and meatballs are cooked though. Stir in beans and heat until piping hot. Season, mix in parsley and serve.

Club Tropicana ice cream cake
Ingredients:
•	1 madeira cake (we used one from M&S that comes in a large rectangular block)
•	500ml tub mango sorbet
•	500ml tub vanilla ice cream
•	50g dark chocolate
•	500ml tub raspberry sorbet
•	150ml double cream, whipped
•	maraschino cherries, to decorate
Steps:
1.	Cut a piece of sponge about 5mm thick to fit a 1lb 16 x 10cm loaf tin and trim off any dark edges (off-cuts are a cook's perk). Line the loaf tin with a double layer of strong cling film and push the sponge into the base. If the madeira cake is smaller than the tin, patch any gaps – you won’t see them when the cake is finished.
2.	Spoon a layer of mango sorbet into the tin using three-quarters of the tub, flatten the surface using the back of a spoon and freeze for 10 mins. Repeat using the vanilla ice cream, then add another layer of sponge. Melt the chocolate and pour it over the second layer of sponge. Freeze for 10 mins, then carefully add a layer of raspberry sorbet in the same way, followed by a final layer of sponge. Cover the lot in cling film, then freeze until you need it. Turn the ice cream cake out of the tin onto a plate and peel off the cling film, then decorate the top with whipped cream and cherries. Wait 10 mins before slicing with a long, straight-edged knife. Extra cherries are optional.

 
Four banana ice cream sandwiches Quick banana ice cream sandwiches
Ingredients:
•	200g peanut butter (crunchy or smooth is fine)
•	175g golden caster sugar
•	75g dark chocolate, chopped into chunks
•	1 large egg
•	For the ice cream
•	3 bananas, peeled, chopped and frozen in advance
•	2 tbsp double cream
•	1 tsp vanilla essence
Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and line two large baking sheets with baking parchment. Put the peanut butter, sugar, ¼ tsp fine table salt and chocolate chunks in a bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Crack in the egg and mix again until the mixture clumps together and forms a dough.
2.	Break off chunks of dough (about the size of a cherry tomato) and arrange them, spaced apart, on the sheets. Press the cookies down with the back of a fork to squash them a little. (The cookies can be frozen for up to two months – to cook from frozen, add an extra 1-2 mins to the cooking time.) Bake for about 12 mins until golden around the edges and paler in the centre. Leave to cool on the trays for 5 mins.
3.	Meanwhile, put the bananas, cream and vanilla in a food processor and blend until they make a thick ice cream. Scoop into balls with an ice cream scoop, and sandwich between the cookies. Serve immediately.
