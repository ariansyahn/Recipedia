Bechamel Sauce
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons of butter or margarine
3 tablespoons of flour
4 ml of milk
salt
nutmeg

Steps:
Place the butter in a dish, cover and heat at 750 W for one minute.
Stir the flour into the butter, pour in the milk, mixing well.
Cook uncovered at 750 W for 4-7 minutes. Add the salt and nutmeg and beat well using a whisk or beater until you achieve the desired consistency.
For a special touch:
Try replacing the milk with meat, vegetable or fish stock to prepare sauces to be served with meat or fish dishes. Try adding two tablespoons of cream to the sauce.
