Method
1. Pre-heat the oven to 140°C or
275°F or Gas Mark 1.
2. Prepare the tin. For the bottom of the tin: cut
either circles or squares of double-thickness
greaseproof paper. For the sides: Cut a strip of
double greaseproof paper about 1 inch higher
than the depth of the tin. (Grease well).
3. Weigh all the ingredients carefully.
4. Place all the cake ingredients together in a very
large mixing bowl or basin and beat with a
wooden spoon until well mixed (4–6 minutes).
5. Place this mixture in the prepared
tin and smooth the top with the
back of a wet dessertspoon.
6. Bake in the pre-heated oven on the middle
shelf for approximately 5–6 hours. Check at
intervals after 2½ hours as ovens tend to vary.
Cover the cake with double greaseproof paper
or foil for about the last 1–2 hours, to prevent
the top of the cake from becoming too brown.
7. Test the cake carefully before
removing it from the oven.
8. Leave the cake to cool in the tin overnight.
Turn out and remove papers, then store.
