Herby toad in the hole
Ingredients:
•	140g plain flour
•	3 eggs
•	300ml milk
•	2 tsp Dijon mustard
•	2 tbsp vegetable oil
•	8 Cumberland sausages
•	8 sage leaves
•	4 rosemary sprigs

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9. In a food processor, combine the flour, eggs, milk, mustard and some salt and pepper, blitz until smooth, then leave to rest for 30 mins.
2.	Pour the oil into a metal roasting tin about 30 x 23cm and 7.5cm deep. Brush the oil all over the sides and bottom, then place in the oven. When the roasting tin is very hot and smoking, place the sausages inside, evenly spread out, and cook for 5 mins.
3.	Give the rested batter a stir and pour into the really hot tin – take care as it may spit. Quickly sprinkle over the sage leaves and rosemary, then place in the middle of the oven. Do not open the door for 25 mins, then check – if needed, cook for a further 5-10 mins. Cook until puffed up and brown and the batter is completely cooked through. Serve straight from the dish.

Classic summer pudding
Ingredients:
•	300g raspberry, plus a few extra to serve
•	225g blackberry, plus a few extra to serve
•	100g redcurrant, plus a few extra to serve
•	400g strawberry, hulled and quartered
•	140g golden caster sugar, plus a bit extra (optional)
•	400g brioche loaf
•	clotted cream, to serve (optional)

Steps:
1.	Wash the fruit and place it all (except the strawberries) in a large pan with the caster sugar and 3 tbsp water. Gently heat for 3 mins until the juice from the fruit starts to seep out. Add the strawberries and cook for 2 mins more. Drain the juice from the fruit through a sieve set over a large bowl. Taste the juice and add a little more sugar if necessary.
2.	Line a 1.2-litre pudding basin with a double layer of cling film, leaving an overlap around the top. Remove the crusts from the brioche and slice the loaf into 1cm-thick slices along the length of the loaf. Cut 1 slice in half widthways and trim the corners to fit into the base of the bowl – you may need to use both squares, trimmed to fit.
3.	Trim the slices to the correct length to line the sides of the bowl. To assemble the pudding, dip the slices of brioche into the fruit juice, then use them to line the basin. Start with the bottom pieces, then lay soaked rectangles of brioche along the sides of the bowl. If you have any gaps left at the end, patch these up with any remaining brioche, but make sure you save some for the base.
4.	Tip the fruit into the lined basin. Finish the pudding with a layer of brioche to make a base, then pour over any remaining liquid. Wrap the overhanging cling film over the top.
5.	Place a small plate, which will fit snugly on top of the basin, over the cling film and weigh down with 2 x 400g cans of tomatoes or beans. Leave the pudding weighed down in the fridge for at least a couple of hours, or overnight if possible.
6.	To serve, unwrap the cling film and place a serving plate over the pudding. Flip it over, remove the basin and carefully peel away the cling film. Serve in slices with clotted cream, if you like.

No-fail Yorkies
Ingredients:
•	450ml milk
•	4 large eggs
•	250g plain flour
•	2 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil

Steps:
1.	Up to 3-4 hrs before cooking, mix together the milk, eggs, flour and 2 tsp salt in a food processor or blender until you have a smooth batter. If you don’t have a food processor or blender, whisk the eggs into the flour and salt, then gradually whisk in the milk until smooth. Transfer to a jug, cover and leave at room temperature for at least 15 mins.
2.	Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and brush 12 holes of a muffin tin with the oil. Heat the tin in the oven for 5 mins, then carefully lift out and quickly pour the batter into the holes. Bake in the oven for 5 mins, then reduce oven temperature to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and cook for a further 30 mins until puffed, risen and golden.

Oven-Baked Salmon
Ingredients:
•	12 ounce salmon fillet, cut into 4 pieces
•	Coarse-grained salt
•	Freshly ground black pepper
•	Toasted Almond Parsley Salsa, for serving
•	Baked squash, for serving, optional
Toasted Almond Parsley Salad:
•	1 shallot
•	1 tablespoons red wine vinegar
•	Coarse grain salt

•	1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley
•	1/2 cup toasted almonds
•	Extra-virgin olive oil

Steps:
1.	Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
2.	Season salmon with salt and pepper. Place salmon, skin side down, on a non-stick baking sheet or in a non-stick pan with an oven-proof handle. Bake until salmon is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve with the Toasted Almond Parsley Salad and squash, if desired.

Toasted Almond Parsley Salad:
3.	Mince the shallot and add to a small bowl. Pour the vinegar over the shallots and add a pinch of salt. Let sit for 30 minutes.

Scampi with tartare sauce
Ingredients:
•	15-20 langoustine or Dublin Bay prawn tails
•	vegetable or sunflower oil, for frying
•	140g plain flour
•	85g cornflour
•	150ml beer
•	100ml sparkling water
•	lemon wedges and chips, to serve
For the tartare sauce
•	6 tbsp mayonnaise
•	1 gherkin or 6 cornichons, finely chopped
•	1 tbsp caper, rinsed and chopped
•	1 tsp lemon juice
•	1 tbsp chopped parsley
•	2 tsp chopped tarragon

Steps:
1.	To prepare the langoustines, pull off the head and pincers. Lay the tail flat on a chopping board and use a sharp pair of scissors to cut a line straight down the back of the shell. Carefully peel the langoustine, score down the back, then remove the grit sac.
2.	Get the oil heating in a large saucepan or wok – you will need enough to come 2-3in up the side of the pan. For the tartare sauce, mix all ingredients in a bowl and season.
3.	Place the flours in a bowl with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Add the beer and sparkling water, and whisk to a smooth batter.
4.	To test if the oil is hot enough, put a drop of batter into the pan – it should crisp and brown within 30 secs. Dip each langoustine or prawn tail into the batter, then carefully drop it into the oil. Drizzle a little extra batter over each one while they are cooking – this will give you a really crispy coating. Cook them in batches, making sure you don’t overcrowd the pan. When golden and floating to the surface, scoop out and drain well on kitchen paper. Sprinkle the scampi with salt and serve with the tartare sauce, lemon wedges and chips.
