Venison meatball & wild mushroom stroganoff	
Ingredients:
•	1 onion, finely chopped
•	2 garlic cloves, crushed
•	2 tbsp sunflower oil
•	small bunch dill, roughly chopped plus 1 tbsp finely chopped
•	2 tbsp wholegrain mustard
•	400g venison mince
•	100g fresh white breadcrumbs
•	1 medium egg, beaten
•	25g butter
•	400g wild mushrooms, larger ones sliced
•	½ tsp smoked paprika
•	1 tbsp plain flour
•	400g beef stock
•	150ml brandy
•	2 tsp Dijon mustard
•	1 tbsp tomato purée
•	300ml pot soured cream
•	pinch of sugar  (optional)
•	buttered tagliatelle, rice or sautéed potatoes, to serve	
Steps:
1.	Gently cook the onion and garlic in 1 tbsp oil until really soft. Cool for 10 mins, then tip into a big bowl with the finely chopped dill, 1 tbsp of the wholegrain mustard, the venison, breadcrumbs and egg with 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp ground black pepper. Squelch together with your hands, squeezing the mince well to tenderise it as you mix.
2.	Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan or sauté pan and fry the meatballs in small batches until well browned – add a splash more oil if needed towards the end. Set aside the meatballs in a dish.
3.	Add the butter to the pan and fry the mushrooms over a very high heat until the juices have evaporated and the mushrooms are turning golden. Lower the heat and stir in the paprika and flour for 1 min.
4.	Stir in the stock and brandy, and bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits stuck in the pan. Lift out the mushrooms with a slotted spoon to a dish. Boil the sauce for 3 mins, then stir in the remaining 1 tbsp wholegrain mustard, the Dijon mustard, tomato purée and soured cream. Simmer the sauce until it has reduced again and is a good consistency – anything up to 15 mins depending on your pan. Return the meatballs and any juice and simmer gently until they are cooked through. Stir in the mushrooms to warm through, and season to taste, plus a pinch of sugar if needed. Scatter with the remaining dill and eat with buttered tagliatelle, rice or sautéed potatoes.
