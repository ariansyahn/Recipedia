Meatballs with spaghetti
Ingredients:
•	pack of 8 good-quality sausages
•	500g pack minced beef
•	4 garlic cloves, crushed
•	small bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped
•	3 tbsp dried breadcrumbs
•	1 egg, lightly beaten
•	plain flour for rolling
•	4 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil
•	2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes
•	pinch sugar
•	500g spaghetti
•	grated parmesan, to serve

Steps:
1.	Cut through the skin of each sausage and pull them off. Put the sausage meat into a large bowl with the mince. Add half the garlic, half the parsley, the breadcrumbs and egg, and mix well. Season generously with pepper and a little salt, and mix again.
2.	Sprinkle a chopping board with flour. Scoop out level dessertspoons of the mix, dip them in the flour and roll them into balls. Heat 3 tbsp of the oil in a large frying pan or wok, then fry the meatballs in batches, browning them on all sides. Set aside on a plate. When you’ve fried all the meatballs, pour away any excess fat. Rinse and dry the pan.
3.	Pour the remaining oil into the pan, heat for 1 min then add the remaining garlic and fry for a few seconds. Tip in the tomatoes and break them down with a fork or wooden spoon. Cook over a moderately high heat for 5 mins until jammy. Season with salt, pepper and a little sugar.
4.	Tip in the meatballs and turn them over in the sauce, ensuring they’re all covered. Cover the pan and cook the meatballs on a low heat for about 30 mins, spoon over the sauce occasionally and add a little water if it’s becoming too dry. 15 mins before the end of the cooking time, cook the spaghetti. To serve, stir most of the remaining parsley into the sauce then spoon the meatballs and sauce over the spaghetti. Scatter with last of the parsley and serve Parmesan on the side.

Lamb & rosemary koftas
Ingredients:
•	500g lamb mince
•	½ tsp allspice
•	2 garlic cloves, crushed
•	8 rosemary sprigs
•	4 pitta breads
•	170g pot Greek yogurt
•	2 lemons, cut into wedges
•	150g pack radishes, sliced
•	½ cucumber, chopped

Steps:
1.	Heat the grill to high. In a large bowl, mix together the mince, allspice and garlic. Season and shape into 8 koftas, each wrapped around a rosemary sprig, with the stalk sticking out at one end. Repeat until all the mince is used up. Brush the koftas with a little oil and place on a baking tray. Grill for 10 mins or until cooked through, turning once.
2.	Eat the koftas from the rosemary stalks or pull out the stalks before serving. Serve with the pitta, yogurt, lemon wedges, radishes, cucumber and pickled chillies, if using.

Meatballs with fennel & balsamic beans & courgette noodles
Ingredients:
•	400g lean beef steak mince
•	2 tsp dried oregano
•	1 large egg
•	8 garlic cloves, 1 finely grated, the other sliced
•	1-2 tbsp rapeseed oil
•	1 fennel bulb, finely chopped, fronds reserved
•	2 carrots, finely chopped
•	500g carton passata
•	4 tbsp balsamic vinegar
•	600ml reduced-salt vegetable bouillon
•	For the courgette noodles
•	1 tsp rapeseed oil
•	1-2 large courgettes, cut into noodles with a julienne peeler or spiralizer
•	350g frozen soya beans, thawed

Steps:
1.	Put the mince, oregano, egg and grated garlic in a bowl and grind in some black pepper. Mix together thoroughly and roll into 16 balls.
2.	Heat the oil in a large sauté pan over a medium-high heat, add the meatballs and fry, moving them around the pan so that they brown all over – be careful as they’re quite delicate and you don’t want them to break up. Once brown, remove them from the pan. Reduce the heat slightly and add the fennel, carrots and sliced garlic to the pan and fry, stirring until they soften, about 5 mins.
3.	Tip in the passata, balsamic vinegar and bouillon, stir well, then return the meatballs to the pan, cover and cook gently for 20-25 mins.
4.	Meanwhile, heat the 1 tsp of oil in a non-stick pan and stir-fry the courgette with the beans to heat through and soften. Serve with the meatballs and scatter with any fennel fronds.

Lamb meatballs with watercress dressing
Ingredients:
•	500g lamb mince
•	100g feta, crumbled
•	100g bag watercress
•	small pack mint, leaves picked and roughly chopped
•	3 tbsp olive oil
•	1 tbsp red wine vinegar
•	300g couscous
•	200g frozen peas
•	100g pomegranate seeds, to serve
•	100g natural yogurt, to serve

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a baking tray with parchment. Mix the lamb, feta and some seasoning in a large bowl. Roll the mince mixture into 20 walnut-sized balls. Put the meatballs on the prepared tray and bake in the oven for 20 mins until cooked through.
2.	To make the dressing, whizz 25g of watercress, the mint, oil, vinegar and plenty of seasoning in a small food processor until smooth. Tip the couscous into a heatproof bowl and cover with 400ml boiling water. Cover with cling film and leave for 3-4 mins. Remove the cling film and fluff up with a fork.
3.	Meanwhile, bring a small pan of water to the boil, add the peas and cook for 3 mins. Mix half the dressing, the peas and remaining watercress into the couscous. Top with the meatballs and serve with the remaining dressing, the pomegranate seeds and yogurt.

Summer courgetti & meatballs
Ingredients:
•	400g pork mince
•	4 garlic cloves, 2 crushed, 2 left whole and unpeeled
•	2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for frying
•	400g cherry tomatoes
•	4 fat courgettes
•	4 tbsp half-fat crème fraîche
•	zest 1 lemon
•	50g pine nuts, toasted
•	large handful basil
•	parmesan shavings, to serve (optional)

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the mince in a bowl, season well and add the crushed garlic. Mix together with your hands, then shape into small meatballs – roughly the size of a cherry tomato. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large frying pan, add the meatballs and fry for 10-15 mins until golden brown. Meanwhile, tip the tomatoes into a roasting tin with the whole garlic cloves and the remaining oil. Season and roll around the tin until well coated in oil, then roast for 15 mins.
2.	While the meatballs and tomatoes cook, use a spiralizer – I used the finer noodle attachment – or a julienne peeler to create courgette noodles. Once cooked, tip the meatballs into the roasting tin with the tomatoes, fish out the garlic and set aside, then cover the tin with foil to keep warm.
3.	Wash the frying pan. Heat another 1 tbsp oil in the pan, squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins into the pan and mash with a fork. When sizzling, add the crème fraîche, lemon zest and some seasoning. Add the courgetti and toss in the pan for 30 secs until warmed through – any longer and it will wilt. Remove the pan from the heat, and tip in the meatballs, tomatoes and any juices from the tin. Toss together and scatter with pine nuts, basil and Parmesan, if you like.
