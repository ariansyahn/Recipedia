Pheasant meatballs with orzo
Ingrdients:
•	1 shallot, roughly chopped
•	1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
•	150g leftover pheasant meat picked from the carcass (including skin and fat)
•	100g fresh breadcrumbs
•	zest and juice 1 lemon
•	1 tbsp natural yogurt
•	1 large egg
•	2 tbsp pistachio nuts, chopped
•	2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley
•	small grating nutmeg
•	3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
•	2 rosemary sprigs
•	200g orzo
•	80g baby spinach leaves
•	4 tbsp crème fraîche
•	20g finely grated parmesan, plus extra to serve

Steps:
1.	To make the meatballs, put the shallot, garlic and pheasant into a blender and process until finely chopped. Add the breadcrumbs, lemon zest and juice, yogurt and egg and blitz once more, until the mixture is clumping together, then tip into a bowl. Add the pistachios and parsley, stir well and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Oil your hands and roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs. Put in the fridge to chill.
2.	Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. In a heavy-bottomed, non-stick frying pan or skillet, heat the olive oil and rosemary, and stir to infuse the oil, then add the meatballs and fry for 4-5 mins, turning them carefully to brown all over. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, retaining the rosemary oil, and transfer the meatballs to a roasting tin. Put them in the oven for 10 mins to heat through while you cook the pasta.
3.	Cook the orzo following pack instructions, and drain when al dente, reserving some of the water. Remove the sprigs of rosemary from the olive oil in the frying pan and tip in the pasta along with the spinach, stirring to coat in the infused oil. Warm gently over a low heat then stir in the crème fraîche and Parmesan, plus a little pasta water (or stock, if you have it). Season and divide between plates, topping with the meatballs. Serve with extra Parmesan, if you like.

Toddler recipe: Batch-cook mini pork & veg balls
Ingredients:
For the meatballs
•	2 tsp rapeseed oil
•	1 small onion, chopped
•	1 slice wholemeal bread, torn into chunks
•	1 carrot, cut into chunks
•	1 celery stick, cut into chunks
•	1 red pepper, cut into chunks
•	500g lean pork mince
•	1 egg
For the sauce
•	1 tsp rapeseed oil
•	2 garlic cloves, crushed
•	2 x 390g cartons passata
•	1 tsp dried thyme
•	1 tsp sugar (optional)
•	fresh basil or parsley, chopped (optional)
•	cooked spaghetti and grated cheese, to serve

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Heat 2 tsp rapeseed oil in a medium saucepan. Add the onion and cook for 5-10 mins until softened. Blitz the bread in a food processor until you have breadcrumbs. Add the cooked onion, carrot, celery and peppers and pulse until finely chopped. You may need to use a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl a few times. Add the pork, egg and a little black pepper, then pulse to combine.
2.	Divide the mixture in half. Shape half into small meatballs about the size of large marbles and arrange on a baking tray lined with foil. Shape the rest into golf-ball-sized meatballs. Arrange on a lined tray and open freeze. Once frozen, transfer to a freezer bag and save for another meal. Now bake the mini meatballs for 25 mins or until browned and cooked through.
3.	Meanwhile, make the sauce. Using the same pan that you cooked the onion in, heat the 1 tsp oil, add the garlic and cook for 2 mins. Pour in the passata, add the thyme and sugar. Simmer for 5-10 mins. Gently stir the meatballs and any juices into the sauce and heat through for a few mins. Stir the meatballs through the spaghetti and serve with grated cheese.

Asparagus & meatball orzo
Ingredients:
•	pack of 12 pork meatballs
•	500g pack orzo pasta
•	large bunch of asparagus, sliced in half lengthways
•	200g tub crème fraîche

Steps:
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the meatballs on a tray lined with foil, season and cook for 20 mins until cooked through. Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the orzo and cook for 4 mins, then add the asparagus and simmer for 4 mins more. Drain, then tip back into the pan along with the meatballs and crème fraîche, mix and season well.


Spaghetti & meatballs
Ingredients:
•	8 good-quality pork sausages
•	1kg beef mince
•	1 onion, finely chopped
•	½ a large bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
•	85g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve if you like
•	100g fresh breadcrumbs
•	2 eggs, beaten with a fork
•	olive oil, for roasting
•	spaghetti, to serve (you'll need about 100g per portion)
For the sauce
•	3 tbsp olive oil
•	4 garlic cloves, crushed
•	4 x 400g cans chopped tomato
•	125ml red wine (optional)
•	3 tbsp caster sugar
•	½ a large bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
•	few basil leaves (optional)

Steps:
1.	First make the meatballs. Split the skins of 8 good-quality pork sausages and squeeze out the meat into your largest mixing bowl.
2.	Add 1kg beef mince, 1 finely chopped onion, ½ large bunch flat-leaf parsley, 85g grated parmesan, 100g fresh breadcrumbs, 2 beaten eggs and lots of seasoning. Get your hands in and mix together really well – the more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the meatballs will be.
3.	Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.
4.	Roll the mince mixture into about 50 golf-ball-size meatballs. Set aside any meatballs for freezing, allowing about 5 per portion, then spread the rest out in a large roasting tin – the meatballs will brown better if spaced out a bit. 
5.	Drizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp per portion), shake to coat, then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.
6.	Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in your largest pan. Add 4 crushed garlic cloves and sizzle for 1 min.
7.	Stir in four 400g cans chopped tomatoes, 125ml red wine, if using, 3 tbsp caster sugar, ½ a large bunch flat-leaf parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened.
8.	Stir in a few basil leaves, if using, spoon out any portions for freezing, then add the cooked meatballs to the pan to keep warm while you boil the spaghetti (you'll need about 100g per portion). 
9.	Spoon the sauce and meatballs over spaghetti, or stir them all together and serve with extra parmesan and a few basil leaves, if you like.
