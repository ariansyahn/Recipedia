Pork with Onions and Peppers
Ingredients:
400 g pork, diced
1-2 onions
2-3 peppers (use different colours)
2-3 tablespoons oil
1 tablespoon potato starch
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons cream + a splash of milk
Salt
Pepper

Steps:
Peel and slice the onions, then remove the seeds from the peppers and cut them into thin strips. Place the meat, onion and oil in a microwaveable casserole dish and stir well. Cover and cook for 10 minutes at 750 W.
Add the peppers, stir, cover and continue cooking for
8-10 minutes at 500 W. Reduce the power if the mixture boils too vigorously.
Mix the starch with the water and pour over the meat, cover and continue cooking for a further 2 minutes at 750 W.
Thin the cream lightly with a splash of milk, pour it into the casserole dish, stir, cover and leave to stand for a further
5-10 minutes before serving.
