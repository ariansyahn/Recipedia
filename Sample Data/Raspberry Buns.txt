Raspberry Buns
Ingredients
››12oz or 340g self-raising flour
››4oz or 110g sugar
››2oz or 50g margarine
››2 eggs
››pinch of salt
››4 dessertspoons semi-skimmed milk
››raspberries (fresh or from tin)
››2 dessertspoons water

Method
1. Pre-heat the oven to 230°C or 450°F or Gas Mark 8.
2. Sift the flour, salt and baking powder into a bowl.
Rub in the margarine. Add the sugar and mix well.
3. Beat the eggs with the milk until light and lemon-coloured. Stir this
into the flour mixture, mixing with a knife to get a smooth dough.
(If dough seems slightly dry add cold water carefully a little at a time).
4. Roll dough on a lightly floured board into a thick
roll, and divide in 12 equal portions.
5. Flour hands lightly and roll each portion into a ball. Place
2 inches apart on a greased baking sheet. Make a hole
in the top of each bun and push in some raspberries.
Wet the edges of each hole and pinch together.
6. Brush with milk or egg and dust each bun over with caster sugar.
7. Bake in the pre-heated oven for 15–20 minutes.
