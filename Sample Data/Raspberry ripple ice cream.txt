Raspberry ripple ice cream
Ingredients:
•	250g raspberry, plus extra to serve, if you like
•	225g caster sugar
•	2 large eggs, plus 4 egg yolks
•	600ml double cream
•	sliced mango, sprinkles, or cones, to serve

Steps:
1.	Place the raspberries and 2 tbsp of the sugar in a small pan. Cook on a medium heat until sugar dissolves. Simmer for 5 mins until thickened, then push through a sieve into a bowl and discard the seeds left in the sieve.
2.	Place the eggs, egg yolks and remaining sugar in a bowl. Whisk with an electric whisk to combine, then place over a pan of gently simmering water – make sure the bowl isn’t actually touching the water. Beat with the electric whisk for 3-4 mins until thick and pale. Remove from heat and continue beating until cool.
3.	In another bowl, whisk the cream until it forms soft peaks, then gently fold into the cool egg mix until just combined. Pour the mix into a shallow container or dish that can be frozen.
4.	Gently swirl the raspberry coulis through, cover with cling film and freeze for at least 6 hrs. Serve scoops in bowls with sliced mango and extra raspberries, or scoop into cones and top with sprinkles for the kids.
