Roast lamb with spring herb crumbs
Ingredients:
For the crumbs
•	100g good-quality white bread
•	2 garlic cloves
•	zest 1 lemon
•	1 tsp thyme leaf, chopped
•	small bunch parsley, chopped
•	3-4 anchovy fillets, chopped (optional)
For the lamb
•	5 carrots, cut into chunks
•	2 onions, cut into chunks
•	4 bay leaves
•	small bunch rosemary
•	2 tbsp olive oil
•	large leg of lamb, about 3kg/6lb 8oz
•	3 garlic cloves, thickly sliced, plus a whole bulb, halved
For the gravy
•	5 tbsp plain flour
•	200ml white wine, plus a splash
•	600ml lamb stock

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. For the lamb, scatter the vegetables, bay leaves and a few rosemary sprigs into a large roasting tin and drizzle with the olive oil. Use a sharp knife to make little slits all over the lamb. Poke a slice of garlic and a small sprig of rosemary into each one. Sit the lamb on top of the veg in the roasting tin, add a splash of wine, then cook for 2 hrs if you like it pink, or 2 hrs 15 mins for cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer to a board and cover with foil, then rest for 45 mins-1 hr.
2.	To make the gravy, pour off most of the fat from the tin but leave the veg and any meat juices. Place the tin on the heat to caramelise the veg, then stir in the flour and cook to a paste. Gradually stir in the wine, cook for a min, then stir in the stock and simmer until you have a tasty gravy. Push the gravy through a sieve into a small pan and keep warm.
3.	Turn oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. For the crumbs, blitz everything in a food processor and scatter over a tray. Bake in the oven for 10-15 mins until crisp, then re-blitz or break up with your fingers to crumbs again. These can be made in advance and kept in an airtight container for 2 days. Serve the lamb carved into slices, sprinkled with crumbs and a jug of gravy alongside.

Classic summer pudding
Ingredients:
•	300g raspberry, plus a few extra to serve
•	225g blackberry, plus a few extra to serve
•	100g redcurrant, plus a few extra to serve
•	400g strawberry, hulled and quartered
•	140g golden caster sugar, plus a bit extra (optional)
•	400g brioche loaf
•	clotted cream, to serve (optional)

Steps:
1.	Wash the fruit and place it all (except the strawberries) in a large pan with the caster sugar and 3 tbsp water. Gently heat for 3 mins until the juice from the fruit starts to seep out. Add the strawberries and cook for 2 mins more. Drain the juice from the fruit through a sieve set over a large bowl. Taste the juice and add a little more sugar if necessary.
2.	Line a 1.2-litre pudding basin with a double layer of cling film, leaving an overlap around the top. Remove the crusts from the brioche and slice the loaf into 1cm-thick slices along the length of the loaf. Cut 1 slice in half widthways and trim the corners to fit into the base of the bowl – you may need to use both squares, trimmed to fit.
3.	Trim the slices to the correct length to line the sides of the bowl. To assemble the pudding, dip the slices of brioche into the fruit juice, then use them to line the basin. Start with the bottom pieces, then lay soaked rectangles of brioche along the sides of the bowl. If you have any gaps left at the end, patch these up with any remaining brioche, but make sure you save some for the base.
4.	Tip the fruit into the lined basin. Finish the pudding with a layer of brioche to make a base, then pour over any remaining liquid. Wrap the overhanging cling film over the top.
5.	Place a small plate, which will fit snugly on top of the basin, over the cling film and weigh down with 2 x 400g cans of tomatoes or beans. Leave the pudding weighed down in the fridge for at least a couple of hours, or overnight if possible.
6.	To serve, unwrap the cling film and place a serving plate over the pudding. Flip it over, remove the basin and carefully peel away the cling film. Serve in slices with clotted cream, if you like.

Crispy topped Cumberland pie
Ingredients:
•	2 celery sticks, sliced into 1cm pieces
•	1 onion, chopped
•	2 really big carrots, halved lengthways then chunkily sliced
•	5 bay leaves
•	3 thyme sprigs
•	2 tbsp vegetable oil
•	1 tbsp butter
•	2 tbsp each plain flour, tomato purée and Worcestershire sauce
•	2 beef stock cubes, crumbled
•	850g feather blade beef, or other braising cut, cut into large chunks
•	850g large potato
•	25g each mature cheddar and parmesan, finely grated

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Soften the celery, onion, carrots, bay and 1 thyme sprig in a casserole with 1 tbsp oil and the butter for 10 mins. Stir in the flour, followed by the purée, Worcestershire sauce and stock cubes.
2.	Gradually stir in 600ml hot water, then tip in the beef and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook in the oven for 2 hrs 30 mins, then uncover and cook for 30 mins -1 hr more until the meat is really tender and sauce thickened.
3.	Meanwhile, cook potatoes in a pan of boiling water until they’re not done but about ¾ of the way there.
4.	Transfer meat to a baking dish. Slice spuds into 1cm thick rounds and gently toss with seasoning, the remaining oil and thyme leaves. Layer on the beef, scattering with the cheese as you layer. You can cover and chill the pie now for 1 day, or freeze for up to 3 months.
5.	Increase oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and bake for 30-40 mins until golden and crispy, and sauce bubbling if the dish went in cold. Serve with peas.

Easy meatballs
Ingredients:
•	300g good-quality pork sausage (about 4 large or 8 chipolatas)
•	1 small onion
•	1 carrot
•	1 tbsp dried oregano
•	500g lean beef mince
•	50g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve
•	75g dried breadcrumb
•	1 medium egg
•	1 tbsp olive oil
For the tomato sauce
•	1 carrot (finely grated)
•	2 sticks of celery (grated)
•	1 courgette (coarsely grated)
•	3 garlic cloves (finely grated)
•	2 red peppers
•	1 tbsp olive oil
•	1 tbsp tomato purée
•	pinch golden caster sugar
•	splash red wine vinegar
•	3 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes
•	cooked spaghetti, to serve
•	handful basil leaves, snipped

Steps:
1.	KIDS the writing in bold is for you. GROWN-UPS the rest is for you. Squeeze some sausages. Get your child to squeeze all the sausagemeat out of the skins into a large bowl. They can hold the sausages or do it by squashing them on a board.
2.	Get grating. Get your child to coarsely grate the onion and finely grate the carrot. If the onion starts to hurt their eyes, get them to wear goggles, which is good fun. Grating can take a bit of strength, so you may need to help. Tip these vegetables in with the sausages. While you have the grater out, grate the Parmesan, other vegetables and garlic for the sauce, and set aside.
3.	Make a marvellous mix. Next, get your child to add all the other meatball ingredients one by one, except the olive oil, into the bowl and season with black pepper.
4.	Squish everything together. Get the child to squish everything together through their hands until completely mixed. Keep an eye on younger children to make sure that they don’t taste any of the raw mix.
5.	Roll meatballs. Children as young as three can now roll the meatball mix into walnut-sized balls, then place them on a board or tray. This mix should make 40 balls – counting these is great way to help teach older children basic division. Cover the meatballs with cling film and have a little tidy up.
6.	Prepare the red peppers. Firstly, peel the peppers with a vegetable peeler, cut off the tops and bottoms and remove the seeds. Cut the peppers in half and children from the age of four can cut the peppers into strips.
7.	Make the sauce. A grown-up will need to help here. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the vegetables and garlic and cook for 5 mins. Stir in the tomato purée, sugar and vinegar, leave for 1 min then tip in the tomatoes and simmer for 5 mins. Get the child to help blitz the sauce with a hand blender. Gently simmer the sauce while you cook the meatballs.
8.	Cook the meatballs. Brown the meatballs in the olive oil on all sides then pop them into the sauce, working in batches if necessary. Simmer the meatballs in the sauce for 15 mins, gently stirring until they are cooked through. It’s ready to eat now or cool and freeze in suitable batches for up to 6 months. Serve with spaghetti, some basil and extra Parmesan, if you like.
