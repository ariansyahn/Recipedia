Roasted autumn vegetables with Lancashire cheese
Ingredients:
•	1 large butternut squash (about 600-700g/1lb 5oz - 1lb 9oz in weight)
•	1 medium red onion
•	6 tbsp olive oil
•	1 large sprig fresh sage
•	1 large courgette
•	1 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar
•	100g Lancashire cheese

Steps:
1.	Preheat the oven to fan180C/conventional 200C/ gas 6. Using a sharp knife, cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut the halves into smaller pieces so you can peel them more easily. Chop the flesh into big bite-sized pieces – they don’t have to be neat.
2.	Halve the onion and trim the root end leaving a little on to hold the segments together. Peel and then cut each half into four wedges. Scatter the squash and onion in a large roasting tin so they have plenty of room to roast, drizzle over 5 tbsp of the oil and toss together. Strip the sage leaves from the stem and roughly chop – you should have about 2 tbsps. Scatter over the vegetables and season. Roast for 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
3.	Meanwhile, slice the courgette thickly and toss with the remaining oil. Remove the roasting tin from the oven and push the partly cooked squash and onion to the side. Put the courgette slices flat on the base and season. Roast for a further 10 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender.
4.	Remove tin from the oven, sprinkle the vinegar over the vegetables and toss. Crumble over the Lancashire cheese. Toss lightly so the cheese melts a little and serve.

Sugared scones
Ingredients:
•	85g diced butter
•	350g self-raising flour
•	¼ tsp salt
•	1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
•	4 tbsp caster sugar
•	200ml milk, warmed to room temperature, plus a splash extra
•	crushed sugar cubes, to decorate

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Whizz butter into flour. Tip into a bowl and stir in salt with bicarbonate of soda and sugar. Using a cutlery knife, quickly stir in milk – don’t over-mix.
2.	Tip out onto a lightly floured surface and turn over a couple of times to very gently bring together with your hands. Gently pat to about 1in thick, then stamp out rounds with a floured cutter. Pat together trimmings to stamp out more. Brush the tops with a splash more milk, then scatter with crushed sugar cubes. Bake on a baking sheet for 10-12 mins until risen and golden.

Sausages with apple mash
Ingredients:
•	700g floury potatoes, cut into chunks
•	8 Cumberland sausages
•	25g butter
•	1 onion, thinly sliced
•	2 tsp plain flour
•	250ml beef stock
•	2 apples (about 280g/10oz), peeled and chopped into small chunks
•	3 tbsp milk

Steps:
1.	Cook the potatoes in boiling, salted water for 15 mins until tender. Meanwhile, heat a non-stick frying pan and add the sausages. Cook over a medium heat for 15-20 mins, turning occasionally, until cooked through. Remove from the pan and keep warm.
2.	Add a knob of the butter and the onion to the pan, then cook for 15-20 mins until soft. Stir in the flour, then gradually add the stock, stirring to make a sauce. Simmer for 2 mins, then pour into a jug and keep warm.
3.	Cook the apples in half the remaining butter for 5-10 mins until softened. Drain the potatoes and mash well with the rest of the butter and the milk. Fold in the apple, then serve with the sausages and onion gravy.

Lancashire hotpot
Ingredients:
•	100g dripping or butter
•	900g stewing lamb, cut into large chunks
•	3 lamb kidneys, sliced, fat removed
•	2 medium onions, chopped
•	4 carrots, peeled and sliced
•	25g plain flour
•	2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
•	500ml lamb or chicken stock
•	2 bay leaves
•	900g potato, peeled and sliced

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3.
2.	Heat a little of the 100g dripping or butter in a large shallow casserole dish and brown 900g stewing lamb chunks in batches, lift to a plate, then repeat with 3 trimmed and sliced lamb kidneys.
3.	Fry 2 chopped onions and 4 peeled and sliced carrots in the pan with a little more dripping until golden.
4.	Sprinkle over 25g plain flour, allow to cook for a couple of mins, shake over 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, pour in 500ml lamb or chicken stock, then bring to the boil.
5.	Stir in the stewing lamb and kidneys and 2 bay leaves, then turn off the heat.
6.	Arrange 900g peeled and sliced potatoes on top of the meat, then drizzle with a little more dripping.
7.	Cover, then place in the oven for about 1½ hrs until the potatoes are cooked.
8.	Remove the lid, brush the potatoes with a little more dripping, then turn the oven up to brown the potatoes, or finish under the grill for 5-8 mins until brown.
Scotch eggs
Ingredients:
•	12 large eggs
•	800g good-quality Cumberland or Lincolnshire sausages, skinned
•	5 tbsp curly parsley, finely chopped
•	2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
•	2 tsp English mustard powder
•	2 tsp ground mace
•	12 rashers smoked streaky bacon
•	85g plain flour
•	140-200g/5-7oz dried breadcrumbs
•	about 1 litre/1¾ pints sunflower or vegetable oil, for frying
•	scraps of bread, for testing oil

Steps:
1.	Put 9 eggs into a large saucepan. Cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Once boiling, set the timer for 5 mins. When 5 mins is up, quickly lift the eggs out with a slotted spoon and plunge into a big bowl of cold water.
2.	Put the sausagemeat, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder and mace into a bowl with plenty of seasoning. Break in 1 of the remaining eggs and mix everything together.
3.	Crack remaining 2 eggs into a bowl, beat with a fork, then sieve onto a plate. Tip the flour onto another plate and season well. Finally, tip the breadcrumbs onto a third plate.
4.	Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Drop in the bacon rashers, turn off the pan and fish out the bacon with a pair of tongs – it should be just cooked.
5.	When the eggs are cool, tap lightly on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel (Picture A). If you hold the eggs over the bowl of water as you peel, all the shell bits will collect in there and you can dip in the egg to wash off any fragments. Wrap a slice of bacon around the middle of each egg, overlapping, like a belt (Picture B).
6.	Now finish coating the eggs. I set up the ingredients along my bench like a conveyer belt: eggs, then flour, mince, beaten egg and finally breadcrumbs, plus a baking parchment-lined tray at the end to put the finished scotch eggs on.
7.	Roll your bacon-wrapped eggs in the flour, shaking off excess. Take a good chunk of mince and pat out to thinly cover one hand. Sit the egg on the meat (Picture C), then mould over the mince to cover, squeezing and patting so it is an even thickness. You’ll probably have a gap (depending on how big your hands are – just patch and pat with a bit more mince). Dip in the egg, shaking off the excess, then roll in the breadcrumbs to coat, and transfer to your tray. Repeat to cover all 9 eggs, then cover with cling film and chill for 4 hrs or overnight.
8.	To cook, pour the oil in a large, deep saucepan to about 4cm deep. Heat until a small chunk of bread browns in about 1 min. Carefully lower in a scotch egg and fry for about 5 mins, turning gently, until evenly browned. Depending on your pan, you can probably do 2-3 at a time, but don’t overcrowd. Lift out onto a kitchen paper-lined tray. (If you like your scotch eggs warm, pop them into a low oven while you fry the rest.) keep an eye on the oil – if the scotch eggs start browning too quickly, the oil might be too hot and you risk the pork not being cooked before the scotch egg is browned. If the oil gets too cool, the scotch egg may overcook before it is browned. enjoy warm or cold; best eaten within 24 hrs of frying.
