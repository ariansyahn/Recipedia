Sausages with apple mash	
Ingredients:
•	700g floury potatoes, cut into chunks
•	8 Cumberland sausages
•	25g butter
•	1 onion, thinly sliced
•	2 tsp plain flour
•	250ml beef stock
•	2 apples (about 280g/10oz), peeled and chopped into small chunks
•	3 tbsp milk	
Steps:
1.	Cook the potatoes in boiling, salted water for 15 mins until tender. Meanwhile, heat a non-stick frying pan and add the sausages. Cook over a medium heat for 15-20 mins, turning occasionally, until cooked through. Remove from the pan and keep warm.
2.	Add a knob of the butter and the onion to the pan, then cook for 15-20 mins until soft. Stir in the flour, then gradually add the stock, stirring to make a sauce. Simmer for 2 mins, then pour into a jug and keep warm.
3.	Cook the apples in half the remaining butter for 5-10 mins until softened. Drain the potatoes and mash well with the rest of the butter and the milk. Fold in the apple, then serve with the sausages and onion gravy.


Steamed cranberry roly-poly	
Ingredients:
•	175g fresh cranberries  (or frozen, thawed)
•	1 tbsp icing sugar
•	2 tbsp cranberry
•	 sauce or jelly
•	300g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
•	140g dried suet
•	85g caster sugar
•	finely grated zest 1 orange
•	175-200ml milk
•	custard, to serve	
Steps:
1.	To make the filling, warm the cranberries and icing sugar together in a saucepan until the fruits begin to soften. Increase the heat, so the juices boil and become jammy. Pour the mixture into a bowl, then stir in the cranberry sauce or jelly. Leave to cool. Butter and lightly flour a large sheet of greaseproof (about 40 x 30cm), and sit it on a bigger sheet of foil. Put a steamer on to simmer.
2.	For the dough, mix together the flour, suet, caster sugar and orange zest with a wooden spoon. Stir in some milk until the mixture reaches the consistency of a soft pastry. Gather together into a ball, but don’t overwork or it will toughen.
3.	On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle about 22cm x 25cm. Spread with the cooled cranberry mix, leaving a 2cm border around the edge. Moisten the border with cold water or milk before rolling into a cylinder. Start by tucking over the border of one of the short ends, then lift as you roll (see step 1, click photo above) so the jam doesn’t get squeezed out. With the long join underneath, lay the roly-poly in the centre of the parchment paper. Fold over the long paper and foil edges to seal, leaving enough space above the pudding to allow it to rise. Squeeze the paper ends together tightly to seal them.
4.	Lay the parcel in the steamer over the simmering water, cover and steam for 1¼-1½ hrs, until firm to the touch. Rest for a min or two before unwrapping, slicing and serving. Vanilla custard is the perfect accompaniment and the roly-poly is best eaten as soon as it is made.

•	200g caster sugar
•	1 tsp vanilla extract
•	4 medium eggs
•	200g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
•	about 6 tbsp raspberry jam

2.	Place 200g softened unsalted butter, 200g caster sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract into a bowl and beat well to a creamy consistency.
3.	Slowly beat in 4 medium eggs, one by one, then fold in 200g self-raising flour and mix well. 
4.	Divide the mix between the cake tins, place into the oven and bake for about 20 mins until risen and golden brown. The cakes should spring back when gently pushed in the middle.
5.	When ready, remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 mins in the tin, before turning out onto a wire rack and cooling completely.
6.	Spread about 6 tbsp raspberry jam onto one cake and top with 250ml whipped double cream. Sandwich the cakes together and dust with icing sugar.


Beef Wellington	
Ingredients:
•	a good beef fillet (preferably Aberdeen Angus) of around 1kg/2lb 4oz
•	3 tbsp olive oil
•	250g/ 9oz chestnut mushroom, include some wild ones if you like
•	50g/ 2oz butter
•	1 large sprig fresh thyme
•	100ml/ 3½ fl oz dry white wine
•	12 slices prosciutto
•	500g/1lb 2oz pack puff pastry, thawed if frozen
•	a little flour, for dusting
•	2 egg yolks beaten with 1 tsp water	
Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7
2.	Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.
3.	While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushroomsas finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.
4.	Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butterin a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.
5.	Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred.
6.	Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.
7.	Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row.
8.	Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over.
9.	Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.
10.	Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.
11.	Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.
12.	Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm.
13.	Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry.
14.	Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp waterand brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet.
15.	Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides.
16.	Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle.
17.	Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.
18.	Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.
19.	Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.
