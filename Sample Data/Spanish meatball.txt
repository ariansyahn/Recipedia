Spanish meatball & butter bean stew
Ingredients:
•	350g lean pork mince
•	2 tsp olive oil
•	1 large red onion, chopped
•	2 peppers, sliced, any colour will do
•	3 garlic cloves, crushed
•	1 tbsp sweet smoked paprika
•	2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes
•	400g can butter beans, drained
•	2 tsp golden caster sugar
•	small bunch parsley, chopped
•	crusty bread, to serve (optional)

Steps:
1.	Season the pork, working the seasoning in with your hands, then shape into small meatballs. Heat the oil in a large pan, add the meatballs and cook for 5 mins, until golden brown all over. Push to one side of the pan and add the onion and peppers. Cook for a further 5 mins, stirring now and then, until the veg has softened, then stir in the garlic and paprika. Stir everything around in the pan for 1 min, then add the tomatoes. Cover with a lid and simmer for 10 mins.
2.	Uncover, stir in the beans, the sugar and some seasoning, then simmer for a further 10 mins, uncovered. Just before serving, stir in the parsley. Serve with crusty bread for dunking, if you like.




Green spaghetti & meatballs
Ingredients:
•	500g lean pork mince
•	1 apple, grated
•	1 tsp fennel seeds
•	1 tbsp oil
•	250g-300g wholemeal spaghetti (for children, use white spaghetti as wholemeal can be too filling)
•	200g baby spinach, plus extra to serve
•	1 ripe avocado, stoned and peeled, plus extra to serve
•	small bunch basil
•	100g frozen peas
•	25g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve

Steps:
1.	Mix the mince, apple and fennel seeds in a bowl. Divide and roll into 24 cherry tomato-sized balls. Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Cook the meatballs until golden brown and cooked through. Heat a large pan of water and cook the pasta following pack instructions.
2.	Meanwhile, make the sauce. Set aside a handful of spinach, 4 tbsp peas and half the avocado for later. Pour hot water over the rest of the peas to defrost them, then drain well. Whizz the defrosted peas, spinach, avocado, basil and parmesan in a blender with 100ml pasta water, adding more if needed, to make sauce. Season well.
3.	Add the reserved frozen peas to the pasta for the last min of cooking. Drain, saving some of the water, and tip the pasta into the meatball pan. Add the sauce and cook for a minute or 2 until hot, adding more seasoning or pasta water if you need to. Serve a salad of spinach and avocado on the side and top the pasta with extra parmesan for adults, if you like.



Beef Wellington
Ingredients:
•	a good beef fillet (preferably Aberdeen Angus) of around 1kg/2lb 4oz
•	3 tbsp olive oil
•	250g/ 9oz chestnut mushroom, include some wild ones if you like
•	50g/ 2oz butter
•	1 large sprig fresh thyme
•	100ml/ 3½ fl oz dry white wine
•	12 slices prosciutto
•	500g/1lb 2oz pack puff pastry, thawed if frozen
•	a little flour, for dusting
•	2 egg yolks beaten with 1 tsp water

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7
2.	Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.
3.	While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushroomsas finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.
4.	Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butterin a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.
5.	Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred.
6.	Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.
7.	Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row.
8.	Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over.
9.	Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.
10.	Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.
11.	Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.
12.	Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm.
13.	Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry.
14.	Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp waterand brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet.
15.	Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides.
16.	Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle.
17.	Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.
18.	Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.
19.	Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.




Fish pie - in four steps
Ingredients:
•	400g skinless white fish fillet
•	400g skinless smoked haddock fillet
•	600ml full-fat milk
•	1 small onion, quartered
•	4 cloves
•	2 bay leaves
•	4 eggs
•	small bunch parsley, leaves only, chopped
•	100g butter
•	50g plain flour
•	pinch freshly grated nutmeg
•	1kg floury potato, peeled and cut into even-sized chunks
•	50g cheddar, grated

Steps:
1.	Poach 400g skinless white fish fillets and 400g skinless smoked haddock fillets. Put the fish in the frying pan and pour over 500ml of the full-fat milk. Quarter 1 small onion and stud each quarter with a clove, then add to the milk, with 2 bay leaves. Bring the milk just to the boil – you will see a few small bubbles. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 mins. Lift the fish onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug to cool. Flake the fish into large pieces in the baking dish.
2.	Hard-boil 4 eggs. Bring a small pan of water to a gentle boil, then carefully lower the eggs in with a slotted spoon. Bring the water back to a gentle boil, with just a couple of bubbles rising to the surface. Set the timer for 8 mins, cook, then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water. Peel, slice into quarters and arrange on top of the fish, then scatter over the chopped leaves of a small bunch of parsley.
3.	Make the sauce. Melt 50g butter in a pan, stir in 50g plain flour and cook for 1 min over moderate heat. Take off the heat, pour in a little of the cold poaching milk, then stir until blended. Continue to add the milk gradually, mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat, bring to the boil and cook for 5 mins, stirring continually, until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, then pour over the fish.
4.	Assemble and bake. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil 1kg floury potatoes, cut into even-sized chunks, for 20 mins. Drain, season and mash with the remaining 50g butter and 100ml full-fat milk. Use to top the pie, starting at the edge of the dish and working your way in – push the mash right to the edges to seal. Fluff the top with a fork, sprinkle over 50g grated cheddar, then bake for 30 mins. Make up to a day ahead, chill, then bake for 40 mins.
