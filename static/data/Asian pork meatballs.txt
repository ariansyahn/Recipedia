Magical instant ice cream

•	300ml semi-skimmed milk
•	1 tbsp caster sugar
•	1 tsp vanilla paste
•	food colouring of your choice
•	2kg ice
•	12 tbsp rock salt
•	sprinkles
Steps:
1.	Place the milk, sugar, vanilla and food colouring of your choice into a medium zip-seal bag, then place this in a second bag to double bag it.
2.	Squeeze the air out, close and secure with sticky tape if the seal isn’t strong.
