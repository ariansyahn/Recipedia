Baked Fish and Chips
Ingredients:
For the Chips:
•	3 medium russet potatoes (1 1/4 pounds)
•	1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
•	Pinch of cayenne pepper
•	Kosher salt
For the Fish:
•	Olive oil cooking spray
•	2 3/4 cups crispy rice cereal
•	Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
•	3 large egg whites
•	1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless Pollock (or other firm white fish), cut into 2-by-4-inch pieces
•	Tartar sauce and/or malt vinegar, for serving (optional)
Steps:
1.	Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F using the convection setting, if available. Place a baking sheet on one of the racks to preheat.
2.	Prepare the chips: Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick sticks. Toss with the olive oil and cayenne in a bowl. Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven, add the potatoes and spread in an even layer. Use a rubber spatula to scrape any oil from the bowl over the potatoes. Bake on the top oven rack, turning once, until browned and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Season with salt.
3.	Meanwhile, make the fish: Set a wire rack on a baking sheet and coat with cooking spray. Lightly crush the cereal in a bowl with your fingers. Add 2 teaspoons salt, and black pepper to taste. In another bowl, whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt until frothy.
4.	Dip the fish in the egg whites, then roll in the cereal crumbs to coat. Place the fish pieces on the rack (position them on their sides so that the majority of the crust is exposed) and mist with cooking spray.
5.	Bake the fish on the bottom oven rack until crisp and just cooked through, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve the fish and chips with tartar sauce and/or malt vinegar, if desired.


Cherry & almond tarts
Ingredients:
•	375g pack all-butter puff pastry
•	75g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
•	12 rounded tsp morello cherry jam
•	75g plain sponge or madeira cake
•	100g butter, softened
•	75g ground almond
•	75g golden caster sugar
•	2 medium eggs
•	½ tsp almond extract
•	25g flaked almond
•	100g icing sugar, sieved to decorate
Steps:
1.	Very thinly roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface. Stamp out 12 x 9cm circles with a fluted cutter, if you have one, and use to line a bun tin. Spread 1 rounded tsp of the cherry jam in the bottom of each tart.
2.	Whizz the cake to crumbs in a food processor, then tip into a mixing bowl and add the flour, butter, ground almonds, caster sugar, eggs and almond extract. Beat together until smooth, then divide between the tarts, spreading a little with the back of a teaspoon to cover the jam. Scatter over the flaked almonds and openfreeze for 2 hrs, then wrap well in cling film and freeze for up to 2 months.
3.	Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 with a baking sheet in it. Unwrap the tarts from the freezer and loosely top with a sheet of foil. Bake on the heated baking sheet for 30-40 mins until golden, removing the foil halfway. Cool the tarts a little, then add a splash of water into the icing sugar to make a runny icing. Drizzle over the tarts and leave to set.


Mini pork pies with piccalilli
Ingredients:
•	few dots of butter 
•	600g shortcrust pastry, bought of homamade
•	little flour, for dusting85g dried white breadcrumb
•	400g good Cumberland sausage (about 6)
•	200g smooked bacon lardon
•	1/4 tsp each ground mace, ground pepper and dried sage
•	1 egg, beaten with a fork
•	few pinches sesame seeds
•	piccalilli, homemade or bought, to serve
Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line each hole of a 12-hole muffin tin with a thin strip of baking parchment across the middle that’s long enough so the ends stick out a centimetre or two – use a dab of butter to stick in place. Roll out two thirds of the pastry on a lightly floured surface and stamp out 12 x 10cm circles (you may need to re-roll trimmings). Press a circle into each hole to line.
2.	Sprinkle 1 tsp of breadcrumbs into the base of each pie. Tip the rest of the crumbs into a mixing bowl. Squeeze in the sausage meat, discarding the skins, along with the bacon, mace, pepper, sage and just a little salt. Get your hands in and mash and squish everything together until the breadcrumbs have just about disappeared. Divide mixture between the holes, packing in firmly and shaping to a dome in the middle.
3.	Roll out the remaining pastry and stamp out 12 x 7cm circles. Brush with a little egg and add a top to each pie, egg-side down to stick, carefully pressing pastry edges together to seal. Brush with more egg (don’t throw away leftovers) and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 30 mins until golden then carefully remove the pies from the tin, using the parchment ends to help you lift them out. Sit on a parchment lined baking tray, brush all round the sides with more egg and put back in the oven for 8 mins. Cool completely then eat with piccalilli, or your favourite pickle.


Roast lamb with spring herb crumbs
Ingredients:
For the crumbs
•	100g good-quality white bread
•	2 garlic cloves
•	zest 1 lemon
•	1 tsp thyme leaf, chopped
•	small bunch parsley, chopped
•	3-4 anchovy fillets, chopped (optional)
For the lamb
•	5 carrots, cut into chunks
•	2 onions, cut into chunks
•	4 bay leaves
•	small bunch rosemary
•	2 tbsp olive oil
•	large leg of lamb, about 3kg/6lb 8oz
•	3 garlic cloves, thickly sliced, plus a whole bulb, halved
For the gravy
•	5 tbsp plain flour
•	200ml white wine, plus a splash
•	600ml lamb stock
Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. For the lamb, scatter the vegetables, bay leaves and a few rosemary sprigs into a large roasting tin and drizzle with the olive oil. Use a sharp knife to make little slits all over the lamb. Poke a slice of garlic and a small sprig of rosemary into each one. Sit the lamb on top of the veg in the roasting tin, add a splash of wine, then cook for 2 hrs if you like it pink, or 2 hrs 15 mins for cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer to a board and cover with foil, then rest for 45 mins-1 hr.
2.	To make the gravy, pour off most of the fat from the tin but leave the veg and any meat juices. Place the tin on the heat to caramelise the veg, then stir in the flour and cook to a paste. Gradually stir in the wine, cook for a min, then stir in the stock and simmer until you have a tasty gravy. Push the gravy through a sieve into a small pan and keep warm.
3.	Turn oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. For the crumbs, blitz everything in a food processor and scatter over a tray. Bake in the oven for 10-15 mins until crisp, then re-blitz or break up with your fingers to crumbs again. These can be made in advance and kept in an airtight container for 2 days. Serve the lamb carved into slices, sprinkled with crumbs and a jug of gravy alongside.
