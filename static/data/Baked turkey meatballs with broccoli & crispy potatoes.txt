Steps:
1.	Fry the onion in 1 tbsp oil until soft, then allow to cool. Mix with the breadcrumbs, mince, cinnamon, 1 egg, ½ tsp salt and lots of pepper, then shape into about 24 meatballs with wet hands. Fry in the remaining oil in a shallow pan for about 8 mins, moving them round until evenly browned. Lift out and set aside.

3.	Stir in the chickpeas and add the meatballs. Make 4 hollows in the sauce, then break in the remaining eggs. Cover and cook for 4-8 mins over a low heat until the eggs are set. Scatter with coriander and serve straight from the pan with crusty bread for scooping up the sauce.

Mini pork pies with piccalilli
Ingredients:
•	few dots of butter 
•	600g shortcrust pastry, bought of homamade
•	little flour, for dusting85g dried white breadcrumb
•	400g good Cumberland sausage (about 6)
•	200g smooked bacon lardon
•	1/4 tsp each ground mace, ground pepper and dried sage
•	1 egg, beaten with a fork
•	few pinches sesame seeds
•	piccalilli, homemade or bought, to serve

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line each hole of a 12-hole muffin tin with a thin strip of baking parchment across the middle that’s long enough so the ends stick out a centimetre or two – use a dab of butter to stick in place. Roll out two thirds of the pastry on a lightly floured surface and stamp out 12 x 10cm circles (you may need to re-roll trimmings). Press a circle into each hole to line.
2.	Sprinkle 1 tsp of breadcrumbs into the base of each pie. Tip the rest of the crumbs into a mixing bowl. Squeeze in the sausage meat, discarding the skins, along with the bacon, mace, pepper, sage and just a little salt. Get your hands in and mash and squish everything together until the breadcrumbs have just about disappeared. Divide mixture between the holes, packing in firmly and shaping to a dome in the middle.
3.	Roll out the remaining pastry and stamp out 12 x 7cm circles. Brush with a little egg and add a top to each pie, egg-side down to stick, carefully pressing pastry edges together to seal. Brush with more egg (don’t throw away leftovers) and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 30 mins until golden then carefully remove the pies from the tin, using the parchment ends to help you lift them out. Sit on a parchment lined baking tray, brush all round the sides with more egg and put back in the oven for 8 mins. Cool completely then eat with piccalilli, or your favourite pickle.

Roast lamb with spring herb crumbs
Ingredients:
For the crumbs
•	100g good-quality white bread
•	2 garlic cloves
•	zest 1 lemon
•	1 tsp thyme leaf, chopped
•	small bunch parsley, chopped
•	3-4 anchovy fillets, chopped (optional)
For the lamb
•	5 carrots, cut into chunks
•	2 onions, cut into chunks
•	4 bay leaves
•	small bunch rosemary
•	2 tbsp olive oil
•	large leg of lamb, about 3kg/6lb 8oz
•	3 garlic cloves, thickly sliced, plus a whole bulb, halved
For the gravy
•	5 tbsp plain flour
•	200ml white wine, plus a splash
•	600ml lamb stock

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. For the lamb, scatter the vegetables, bay leaves and a few rosemary sprigs into a large roasting tin and drizzle with the olive oil. Use a sharp knife to make little slits all over the lamb. Poke a slice of garlic and a small sprig of rosemary into each one. Sit the lamb on top of the veg in the roasting tin, add a splash of wine, then cook for 2 hrs if you like it pink, or 2 hrs 15 mins for cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer to a board and cover with foil, then rest for 45 mins-1 hr.
2.	To make the gravy, pour off most of the fat from the tin but leave the veg and any meat juices. Place the tin on the heat to caramelise the veg, then stir in the flour and cook to a paste. Gradually stir in the wine, cook for a min, then stir in the stock and simmer until you have a tasty gravy. Push the gravy through a sieve into a small pan and keep warm.
3.	Turn oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. For the crumbs, blitz everything in a food processor and scatter over a tray. Bake in the oven for 10-15 mins until crisp, then re-blitz or break up with your fingers to crumbs again. These can be made in advance and kept in an airtight container for 2 days. Serve the lamb carved into slices, sprinkled with crumbs and a jug of gravy alongside.

Green spaghetti & meatballs
Ingredients:
•	500g lean pork mince
•	1 apple, grated
•	1 tsp fennel seeds
•	1 tbsp oil
•	250g-300g wholemeal spaghetti (for children, use white spaghetti as wholemeal can be too filling)
•	200g baby spinach, plus extra to serve
•	1 ripe avocado, stoned and peeled, plus extra to serve
•	small bunch basil
•	100g frozen peas
•	25g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve

Steps:
1.	Mix the mince, apple and fennel seeds in a bowl. Divide and roll into 24 cherry tomato-sized balls. Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Cook the meatballs until golden brown and cooked through. Heat a large pan of water and cook the pasta following pack instructions.
2.	Meanwhile, make the sauce. Set aside a handful of spinach, 4 tbsp peas and half the avocado for later. Pour hot water over the rest of the peas to defrost them, then drain well. Whizz the defrosted peas, spinach, avocado, basil and parmesan in a blender with 100ml pasta water, adding more if needed, to make sauce. Season well.
3.	Add the reserved frozen peas to the pasta for the last min of cooking. Drain, saving some of the water, and tip the pasta into the meatball pan. Add the sauce and cook for a minute or 2 until hot, adding more seasoning or pasta water if you need to. Serve a salad of spinach and avocado on the side and top the pasta with extra parmesan for adults, if you like.
