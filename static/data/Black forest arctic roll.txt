Black forest arctic roll
Ingredients:
For the ice cream
•	2 eggs, separated
•	2 tbsp icing sugar
•	1 vanilla pod, seeds only
•	100ml double cream
•	250g jar black cherries in kirsch
For the sponge
•	knob of butter, for the tin
•	3 eggs
•	100g golden caster sugar, plus extra for dusting
•	100g plain flour
•	2 tbsp cocoa powder
•	½ tsp baking powder
•	1½ tsp vanilla extract
•	red gel food colouring
•	150g black cherry jam

Steps:
1.	To make the ice cream, whisk the egg whites in a bowl with an electric whisk until stiff. In another bowl, whisk the yolks, icing sugar and vanilla seeds until pale and thick like fresh custard. In a third bowl, whip the double cream until just holding its shape. Fold the yolk mixture into the cream and stir in about half of the cherries from the jar, leaving the kirsch behind. Now fold in the egg whites. Pour into a 900g loaf tin lined with a sheet of baking parchment that overlaps each side – you will use this to roll your ice cream later. Freeze for 2 hrs.
2.	Remove the ice cream from the freezer and tin when it feels set but soft. Lift out of the tin on the parchment. Use a spatula to shape the mixture into a rough sausage shape, then use the parchment to roll the mixture tightly together into a cylinder about 35cm in length. Twist the ends of the baking parchment like a cracker and return to the freezer for 1 hr.
3.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line a 24 x 32cm Swiss roll tin with baking parchment (with plenty of excess) and butter well. Whisk the eggs and sugar with an electric hand whisk for 2-3 mins or until thickened and pale. Sift the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder into the egg mixture and add the vanilla extract and fold everything together with a large metal spoon until there are no pockets of flour visible. Scoop 50g of the mixture into a small bowl and add a small amount of red food colouring. Mix well, then transfer to a piping bag. Pipe polka dots onto your prepared Swiss roll tin and bake in the oven for 2 mins. Remove from the oven, then pour the rest of the sponge mixture over to cover the dots and fill the tray completely. Bake for 15 mins or until lightly golden and springy to the touch.
4.	Remove from the oven, allow to cool until cool enough to handle, then carefully roll up the sponge while it’s still warm (keeping the baking parchment attached). Leave to cool completely in its rolled-up shape. Uncurl the sponge and spread the jam on the inside. Working quickly, unwrap the ice cream and put it on top of the jam. Roll the cake up around it.
5.	Wrap the roll in a new sheet of baking parchment and a layer of foil. Return to the freezer for at least a further 20-30 mins, then unwrap, slice and serve.

Ultimate vanilla ice cream
Ingredients:
•	284ml carton double cream
•	300ml full fat milk
•	115g golden caster sugar
•	1 vanilla pod
•	3 large free-range egg yolks
•	have lots of ice cubes at the ready

Steps:
1.	Put the canister from the machine into the freezer a day before you want to make the ice cream. Next day, pour the cream and milk into a medium heavy-based pan, then tip in half the sugar. Slit the vanilla pod down its length with a small sharp knife and scoop out as many of the tiny black seeds as you can into the cream mixture. Cut the pod into three and drop it into the pan.
2.	Heat the cream and milk over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until it almost boils – you’ll see a few bubbles at the edge. Take off the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the vanilla can infuse.
3.	Put the egg yolks into a bowl with the rest of the sugar and beat with an electric hand beater for about 2 minutes until the mixture has thickened, is paler in colour and falls in thick ribbons when you lift the beaters. Using a measuring jug, scoop out about 125ml/4fl oz of the cream mixture and beat into the egg yolks to slacken them. Reheat the cream until it just comes to the boil, take off the heat and stir in the egg yolk mixture.
4.	Return the pan to a low heat and cook, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon, for 8-10 minutes, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Watch that it doesn’t boil – as soon as you see any bubbles about to burst to the surface, it should be thick enough, so take the pan off the heat so the mixture doesn’t curdle.
5.	Pour the custard into a heatproof bowl, then sit it in a bigger bowl one third full of iced water to cool (this takes about 20 minutes). Stir occasionally to stop a skin forming. Put the bowl of custard in the fridge for 3-4 hours, preferably overnight, so it gets really cold.
6.	Get the ice cream machine running, scoop out the vanilla pod pieces, then slowly pour in the cold custard. Leave it to churn for 10-30 minutes (depending on your machine). When it stops, it is probably too soft to eat, so spoon into a plastic container, cover with cling film, then a lid, and freeze for a minimum of 3 hours. (It will keep in the freezer for 3 months but don’t take it out, then refreeze.) Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before serving.
7.	To make it by hand: in step 1, heat the milk, vanilla, and half the sugar without the cream (the custard will be slightly thicker). At the start of step 6, whip the cream so it’s light and floppy, not too stiff, and fold it into the cold custard. Freeze for 3-4 hours, stirring once an hour until almost frozen, then freeze as above.
