British pork cassoulet
Ingredients:
•	400-450g streaky steaks (strips of pork belly ), rind trimmed
•	1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil
•	400-450g pack of pork sausages (try Cumberland, garlic or sage-flavoured Lincolnshire varieties)
•	4 back bacon chops, about 400g/14oz
•	400g can cannellini, haricot, butter or mixed beans, drained
•	1 large onion, chopped
•	4 medium carrots, thickly sliced
•	400g can chopped tomatoes
•	1 bouquet garni 'tea bag'
•	about 600ml chicken stock (from a stock cube is fine)
•	25g fresh white breadcrumbs
•	2 garlic cloves

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Quickly pan-fry the strips of pork belly in the oil, followed by the sausages and back bacon chops, until well browned.
2.	Mix together the beans, onion, garlic, carrots and tomatoes in a bowl. Starting with a spoonful of the veg, inter-layer the vegetable mix and meats in a deep braising pan (about 3 litres capacity, 7.5cm deep, preferably one that will go on top of the stove – see Gary’s tip, below). Place the bouquet garni in the centre as everything is being stacked.
3.	Pour just enough chicken stock on top to almost cover, then bring to a simmer on top of the stove (see Gary’s tip). Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top and braise in the oven for about 1hr 20- 1hr 30 mins, until the meats are all tender and the top is golden brown. If the stock reduces while braising, simply pour a little more on top to moisten. Remove from the oven and allow to settle for 5 mins before serving. (Remember to take out the bouquet garni.)

Rhubarb, pear & hazelnut crumbles

2.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. To make the crumble topping, tip all the ingredients into a food processor and pulse to crumbs. Sprinkle the topping over the fruit filling, then bake for 30 mins or until golden brown on top. Serve with vanilla ice cream or double cream.

The ultimate makeover: Full English breakfast
Ingredients:
•	4 rashers good-quality lean unsmoked back bacon
•	4 brown-cap portabello mushrooms
•	12-16 cherry tomatoes on the vine, room temperature
•	6 tsp olive oil
•	2 slices granary or wholegrain bread, cut on the diagonal
•	2 good-quality free-range pork sausages, minimum 86% pork
•	2 free-range, omega-3 rich eggs, room temperature
•	few drops cider vinegar
•	2 x 100ml / 3½ fl oz glasses freshly-squeezed orange juice, plus 1 orange cut into wedges
•	handful fresh blueberries (about 50g/2oz)

Steps:
1.	Lay the bacon, mushrooms and tomatoes on a foil-lined tray. Brush the tops of the mushrooms with 3 tsp of the oil and both sides of the bread with the remaining oil. Set aside. Heat the grill to very hot. Lay the sausages on a small foil-lined tray (best not to prick good-quality sausages or they may lose moisture). Grill for about 10 mins until cooked, turning occasionally.
2.	Meanwhile, three-quarters fill a small pan, and a wide, deep sauté pan with water. Bring both to the boil. Lower an egg into the small pan and remove after 30 secs. Crack the egg into a cup. Add vinegar to the larger pan then, using a wire whisk, swirl the water around to create a whirlpool. Remove the whisk and slowly tip the egg into the centre of the whirlpool (see top picture). When the water comes back to the boil, remove the pan from the heat, cover and leave for 3 mins, then remove the egg. Place in a bowl of warm water while you cook the other egg – or cook both eggs an hour ahead, leave in a bowl of iced water, then reheat for 1½ mins in simmering water before serving.
3.	Meanwhile heat a griddle pan to very hot. Place the tomatoes, bacon and mushrooms under the grill for 3-4 mins without turning. At the same time, lay the bread on the griddle pan, cook until crisp, about 1 min each side. Drain everything on kitchen paper.
4.	Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and drain briefly on a cloth. Arrange everything on a plate and serve with the juice and fruit.

Steamed cranberry roly-poly
Ingredients:
•	175g fresh cranberries  (or frozen, thawed)
•	1 tbsp icing sugar
•	2 tbsp cranberry
•	 sauce or jelly
•	300g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
•	140g dried suet
•	85g caster sugar
•	finely grated zest 1 orange
•	175-200ml milk
•	custard, to serve

Steps:
1.	To make the filling, warm the cranberries and icing sugar together in a saucepan until the fruits begin to soften. Increase the heat, so the juices boil and become jammy. Pour the mixture into a bowl, then stir in the cranberry sauce or jelly. Leave to cool. Butter and lightly flour a large sheet of greaseproof (about 40 x 30cm), and sit it on a bigger sheet of foil. Put a steamer on to simmer.
2.	For the dough, mix together the flour, suet, caster sugar and orange zest with a wooden spoon. Stir in some milk until the mixture reaches the consistency of a soft pastry. Gather together into a ball, but don’t overwork or it will toughen.
3.	On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle about 22cm x 25cm. Spread with the cooled cranberry mix, leaving a 2cm border around the edge. Moisten the border with cold water or milk before rolling into a cylinder. Start by tucking over the border of one of the short ends, then lift as you roll (see step 1, click photo above) so the jam doesn’t get squeezed out. With the long join underneath, lay the roly-poly in the centre of the parchment paper. Fold over the long paper and foil edges to seal, leaving enough space above the pudding to allow it to rise. Squeeze the paper ends together tightly to seal them.
4.	Lay the parcel in the steamer over the simmering water, cover and steam for 1¼-1½ hrs, until firm to the touch. Rest for a min or two before unwrapping, slicing and serving. Vanilla custard is the perfect accompaniment and the roly-poly is best eaten as soon as it is made.

Roasted autumn vegetables with Lancashire cheese
Ingredients:
•	1 large butternut squash (about 600-700g/1lb 5oz - 1lb 9oz in weight)
•	1 medium red onion
•	6 tbsp olive oil
•	1 large sprig fresh sage
•	1 large courgette
•	1 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar
•	100g Lancashire cheese

Steps:
1.	Preheat the oven to fan180C/conventional 200C/ gas 6. Using a sharp knife, cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut the halves into smaller pieces so you can peel them more easily. Chop the flesh into big bite-sized pieces – they don’t have to be neat.
2.	Halve the onion and trim the root end leaving a little on to hold the segments together. Peel and then cut each half into four wedges. Scatter the squash and onion in a large roasting tin so they have plenty of room to roast, drizzle over 5 tbsp of the oil and toss together. Strip the sage leaves from the stem and roughly chop – you should have about 2 tbsps. Scatter over the vegetables and season. Roast for 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
3.	Meanwhile, slice the courgette thickly and toss with the remaining oil. Remove the roasting tin from the oven and push the partly cooked squash and onion to the side. Put the courgette slices flat on the base and season. Roast for a further 10 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender.
4.	Remove tin from the oven, sprinkle the vinegar over the vegetables and toss. Crumble over the Lancashire cheese. Toss lightly so the cheese melts a little and serve.
