Crispy topped Cumberland pie
Ingredients:
•	2 celery sticks, sliced into 1cm pieces
•	1 onion, chopped
•	2 really big carrots, halved lengthways then chunkily sliced
•	5 bay leaves
•	3 thyme sprigs
•	2 tbsp vegetable oil
•	1 tbsp butter
•	2 tbsp each plain flour, tomato purée and Worcestershire sauce
•	2 beef stock cubes, crumbled
•	850g feather blade beef, or other braising cut, cut into large chunks
•	850g large potato
•	25g each mature cheddar and parmesan, finely grated

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Soften the celery, onion, carrots, bay and 1 thyme sprig in a casserole with 1 tbsp oil and the butter for 10 mins. Stir in the flour, followed by the purée, Worcestershire sauce and stock cubes.
2.	Gradually stir in 600ml hot water, then tip in the beef and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook in the oven for 2 hrs 30 mins, then uncover and cook for 30 mins -1 hr more until the meat is really tender and sauce thickened.
3.	Meanwhile, cook potatoes in a pan of boiling water until they’re not done but about ¾ of the way there.
4.	Transfer meat to a baking dish. Slice spuds into 1cm thick rounds and gently toss with seasoning, the remaining oil and thyme leaves. Layer on the beef, scattering with the cheese as you layer. You can cover and chill the pie now for 1 day, or freeze for up to 3 months.
5.	Increase oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and bake for 30-40 mins until golden and crispy, and sauce bubbling if the dish went in cold. Serve with peas.

Mini pork pies with piccalilli
Ingredients:
•	few dots of butter 
•	600g shortcrust pastry, bought of homamade
•	little flour, for dusting85g dried white breadcrumb
•	400g good Cumberland sausage (about 6)
•	200g smooked bacon lardon
•	1/4 tsp each ground mace, ground pepper and dried sage
•	1 egg, beaten with a fork
•	few pinches sesame seeds
•	piccalilli, homemade or bought, to serve

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line each hole of a 12-hole muffin tin with a thin strip of baking parchment across the middle that’s long enough so the ends stick out a centimetre or two – use a dab of butter to stick in place. Roll out two thirds of the pastry on a lightly floured surface and stamp out 12 x 10cm circles (you may need to re-roll trimmings). Press a circle into each hole to line.
2.	Sprinkle 1 tsp of breadcrumbs into the base of each pie. Tip the rest of the crumbs into a mixing bowl. Squeeze in the sausage meat, discarding the skins, along with the bacon, mace, pepper, sage and just a little salt. Get your hands in and mash and squish everything together until the breadcrumbs have just about disappeared. Divide mixture between the holes, packing in firmly and shaping to a dome in the middle.
3.	Roll out the remaining pastry and stamp out 12 x 7cm circles. Brush with a little egg and add a top to each pie, egg-side down to stick, carefully pressing pastry edges together to seal. Brush with more egg (don’t throw away leftovers) and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 30 mins until golden then carefully remove the pies from the tin, using the parchment ends to help you lift them out. Sit on a parchment lined baking tray, brush all round the sides with more egg and put back in the oven for 8 mins. Cool completely then eat with piccalilli, or your favourite pickle.

Lighter spaghetti & meatballs
Ingredients:
•	1 tsp rapeseed oil
•	280g spaghetti
For the meatballs
•	200g green lentils (well drained weight from a 400g can)
•	250g lean minced pork (max 8% fat)
•	½ tsp finely chopped rosemary
•	½ tsp Dijon mustard
•	1 garlic clove, crushed
For the sauce
•	1 tbsp rapeseed oil
•	2 shallots, finely chopped
•	2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
•	500g cherry tomatoes, preferably on the vine, halved
•	2 tsp tomato purée
•	pinch of chilli flakes
•	2 tbsp chopped oregano, plus a few chopped leaves to garnish

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with foil and brush with 1 tsp oil. Mash the lentils in a bowl with the back of a fork to break down a bit, but not completely. Stir in the pork, rosemary, mustard, garlic, some pepper to generously season, and mix well with the fork to distribute the lentils evenly. Divide the mixture into 4. Form each quarter into 5 small balls – to give you 20 in total – squeezing the mixture together well as you shape it. Lay the meatballs on the foil and roll them around in the oil to coat all over. Bake for 15 mins until cooked and lightly browned. Remove (leave the oven on) and set aside.
2.	While the meatballs cook, heat 2 tsp of the oil for the sauce in a large non-stick frying pan. Tip in the shallots and garlic, and fry on a medium heat for 3-4 mins until softened and tinged brown. Pour in the remaining 1 tsp oil, lay the tomatoes in the pan so most of them are cut-side down (to help release the juices), raise the heat and fry them for 3-4 mins or until the tomatoes are starting to soften and release their juices. Don’t stir, or they may lose their shape. Splash in 125-150ml water so it all bubbles, and gently mix in the tomato purée. Lower the heat and simmer for 2 mins to create a juicy, chunky sauce. Season with the chilli flakes, oregano, pepper and a pinch of salt, and give it a quick stir, adding a drop more water if needed – you want it thick enough to coat the meatballs.
3.	Pour the sauce into a casserole dish, add the meatballs and spoon the sauce over them to coat. Cover with foil and bake for 10 mins while you cook the spaghetti.
4.	Boil a large saucepan of water. Add the spaghetti, stir and bring back to the boil. Cook for 10-12 mins, or following pack instructions, until al dente. Drain well, season with pepper and serve with the meatballs, sauce and a light sprinkling of oregano.
