Four banana ice cream sandwiches Quick banana ice cream sandwiches
Ingredients:
•	200g peanut butter (crunchy or smooth is fine)
•	175g golden caster sugar
•	75g dark chocolate, chopped into chunks
•	1 large egg
•	For the ice cream
•	3 bananas, peeled, chopped and frozen in advance
•	2 tbsp double cream
•	1 tsp vanilla essence	
Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and line two large baking sheets with baking parchment. Put the peanut butter, sugar, ¼ tsp fine table salt and chocolate chunks in a bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Crack in the egg and mix again until the mixture clumps together and forms a dough.
2.	Break off chunks of dough (about the size of a cherry tomato) and arrange them, spaced apart, on the sheets. Press the cookies down with the back of a fork to squash them a little. (The cookies can be frozen for up to two months – to cook from frozen, add an extra 1-2 mins to the cooking time.) Bake for about 12 mins until golden around the edges and paler in the centre. Leave to cool on the trays for 5 mins.
3.	Meanwhile, put the bananas, cream and vanilla in a food processor and blend until they make a thick ice cream. Scoop into balls with an ice cream scoop, and sandwich between the cookies. Serve immediately.



Silly twits ice cream	
Ingredients:
•	4 eggs
•	1 tsp vanilla extract
•	140g caster sugar
•	300ml pot double cream	
Steps:
1.	Separate the eggs. Beat the yolks and and vanilla extract with an electric whisk until light and foamy. Clean the whisk, then in another bowl whisk the egg whites, gradually adding the caster sugar until it is thick and glossy, a bit like making meringues.
2.	Lightly whip the double cream until it softly holds its shape. Mix with the yolks and egg white mixture until everything is combined. Turn into a container, cover and freeze until solid. Take out of the fridge about 10 mins before serving.



Lighter spaghetti & meatballs
Ingredients:
•	1 tsp rapeseed oil
•	280g spaghetti
For the meatballs
•	200g green lentils (well drained weight from a 400g can)
•	250g lean minced pork (max 8% fat)
•	½ tsp finely chopped rosemary
•	½ tsp Dijon mustard
•	1 garlic clove, crushed
For the sauce
•	1 tbsp rapeseed oil
•	2 shallots, finely chopped
•	2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
•	500g cherry tomatoes, preferably on the vine, halved
•	2 tsp tomato purée
•	pinch of chilli flakes
•	2 tbsp chopped oregano, plus a few chopped leaves to garnish	
Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with foil and brush with 1 tsp oil. Mash the lentils in a bowl with the back of a fork to break down a bit, but not completely. Stir in the pork, rosemary, mustard, garlic, some pepper to generously season, and mix well with the fork to distribute the lentils evenly. Divide the mixture into 4. Form each quarter into 5 small balls – to give you 20 in total – squeezing the mixture together well as you shape it. Lay the meatballs on the foil and roll them around in the oil to coat all over. Bake for 15 mins until cooked and lightly browned. Remove (leave the oven on) and set aside.
2.	While the meatballs cook, heat 2 tsp of the oil for the sauce in a large non-stick frying pan. Tip in the shallots and garlic, and fry on a medium heat for 3-4 mins until softened and tinged brown. Pour in the remaining 1 tsp oil, lay the tomatoes in the pan so most of them are cut-side down (to help release the juices), raise the heat and fry them for 3-4 mins or until the tomatoes are starting to soften and release their juices. Don’t stir, or they may lose their shape. Splash in 125-150ml water so it all bubbles, and gently mix in the tomato purée. Lower the heat and simmer for 2 mins to create a juicy, chunky sauce. Season with the chilli flakes, oregano, pepper and a pinch of salt, and give it a quick stir, adding a drop more water if needed – you want it thick enough to coat the meatballs.
3.	Pour the sauce into a casserole dish, add the meatballs and spoon the sauce over them to coat. Cover with foil and bake for 10 mins while you cook the spaghetti.
4.	Boil a large saucepan of water. Add the spaghetti, stir and bring back to the boil. Cook for 10-12 mins, or following pack instructions, until al dente. Drain well, season with pepper and serve with the meatballs, sauce and a light sprinkling of oregano.



Meatball stroganoff	
Ingredients:
•	500g beef mince
•	drizzle of oil
•	1 red onion, sliced
•	2 garlic cloves, crushed
•	200g pack small button mushrooms, sliced
•	2 tbsp tomato purée
•	1 tbsp sweet paprika
•	1 tbsp plain flour
•	1 beef stock cube, made up to 300ml stock
•	150ml pot soured cream
•	small pack parsley, chopped
•	rice, mashed potato or tagliatelle, to serve	
Steps:
1.	Season the beef and shape into walnut-sized meatballs. Heat the oil in a pan and cook the meatballs until brown on all sides. Scoop out of the pan and set aside. Add the onion to the pan and cook for a few mins to soften. Add the garlic and mushrooms, and fry for a few mins until the mushrooms soften and start to brown a little. Stir in the tomato purée, paprika and flour for 1 min, then add the stock, bit by bit, to make a smooth sauce. Return the meatballs to the pan, cover and simmer gently for 15 mins or until the meatballs are cooked through.
2.	Stir in the soured cream and most of the parsley, and season to taste. Serve scattered with the remaining parsley, with rice, mashed potato or tagliatelle.
