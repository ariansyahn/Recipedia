Fragrant pork & rice one-pot
Ingredients:
•	4-6 good-quality sausages
•	1 tbsp olive oil
•	½ onion, finely chopped
•	2 garlic cloves, crushed
•	2 tsp each ground cumin and coriander
•	140g long grain rice
•	850ml vegetable stock
•	400g can chopped tomato
•	½ small bunch coriander, leaves picked

Steps:
1.	Split the sausage skins, squeeze out the meat, then roll it into small meatballs about the size of a large olive. Heat the oil in a large non-stick saucepan, then brown the meatballs well on all sides until cooked – you might need to do this in batches. Set the meatballs aside.
2.	Add the onion and garlic to the pan. Soften for 5 mins, stir in the spices and rice, then cook for another min. Pour in the stock and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any sausagey bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer for 10 mins until the rice is just cooked, then stir in the meatballs with some seasoning. Ladle into bowls, scatter with coriander and serve with crusty bread.

Asian pork meatballs
Ingredients:
•	2 tbsp clear honey
•	3 tbsp fish sauce
•	450g minced pork
•	4 spring onions, finely chopped
•	1 small garlic clove, crushed
•	2 tsp lemongrass, finely chopped
•	1 tsp cornflour
•	1 tbsp finely chopped fresh mint
•	2 tbsp finely chopped fresh coriander
•	olive oil for frying
For the oriental dipping sauce
•	1 tsp chopped fresh coriander
•	3 spring onions, finely sliced
•	2 tbsp lime juice
•	2 tbsp light soy sauce
•	1 tsp sesame oil

Steps:
1.	Make the meatballs. Gently warm the honey in a non-stick frying pan, add the fish sauce and stir to make a syrup. Leave to cool.
2.	Put pork in a bowl and fold in honey syrup, spring onions, garlic, lemongrass, cornflour, mint and coriander. Mix and season with salt and lots of black pepper.
3.	Shape into 20 balls and put on a tray lined with greaseproof paper. Chill for 30 mins. To make the sauce, mix all the ingredients together, then set aside.
4.	Brush the balls with olive oil and fry for 3-4 mins each side. Serve with the sauce.

Amaretti affogato
Ingredients:
•	4 scoops vanilla ice cream
•	4 shots espresso, freshly made and hot
•	8 amaretti biscuits, crushed

Steps:
Divide the ice cream between four coffee cups. Carefully pour a shot of espresso over each, then scatter over the amaretti biscuit crumbs. Serve immediately while some of the ice cream is still frozen.

Club Tropicana ice cream cake
Ingredients:
•	1 madeira cake (we used one from M&S that comes in a large rectangular block)
•	500ml tub mango sorbet
•	500ml tub vanilla ice cream
•	50g dark chocolate
•	500ml tub raspberry sorbet
•	150ml double cream, whipped
•	maraschino cherries, to decorate

Steps:
1.	Cut a piece of sponge about 5mm thick to fit a 1lb 16 x 10cm loaf tin and trim off any dark edges (off-cuts are a cook's perk). Line the loaf tin with a double layer of strong cling film and push the sponge into the base. If the madeira cake is smaller than the tin, patch any gaps – you won’t see them when the cake is finished.
2.	Spoon a layer of mango sorbet into the tin using three-quarters of the tub, flatten the surface using the back of a spoon and freeze for 10 mins. Repeat using the vanilla ice cream, then add another layer of sponge. Melt the chocolate and pour it over the second layer of sponge. Freeze for 10 mins, then carefully add a layer of raspberry sorbet in the same way, followed by a final layer of sponge. Cover the lot in cling film, then freeze until you need it. Turn the ice cream cake out of the tin onto a plate and peel off the cling film, then decorate the top with whipped cream and cherries. Wait 10 mins before slicing with a long, straight-edged knife. Extra cherries are optional.

 
Ultimate vanilla ice cream
Ingredients:
•	284ml carton double cream
•	300ml full fat milk
•	115g golden caster sugar
•	1 vanilla pod
•	3 large free-range egg yolks
•	have lots of ice cubes at the ready

Steps:
1.	Put the canister from the machine into the freezer a day before you want to make the ice cream. Next day, pour the cream and milk into a medium heavy-based pan, then tip in half the sugar. Slit the vanilla pod down its length with a small sharp knife and scoop out as many of the tiny black seeds as you can into the cream mixture. Cut the pod into three and drop it into the pan.
2.	Heat the cream and milk over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until it almost boils – you’ll see a few bubbles at the edge. Take off the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the vanilla can infuse.
3.	Put the egg yolks into a bowl with the rest of the sugar and beat with an electric hand beater for about 2 minutes until the mixture has thickened, is paler in colour and falls in thick ribbons when you lift the beaters. Using a measuring jug, scoop out about 125ml/4fl oz of the cream mixture and beat into the egg yolks to slacken them. Reheat the cream until it just comes to the boil, take off the heat and stir in the egg yolk mixture.
4.	Return the pan to a low heat and cook, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon, for 8-10 minutes, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Watch that it doesn’t boil – as soon as you see any bubbles about to burst to the surface, it should be thick enough, so take the pan off the heat so the mixture doesn’t curdle.
5.	Pour the custard into a heatproof bowl, then sit it in a bigger bowl one third full of iced water to cool (this takes about 20 minutes). Stir occasionally to stop a skin forming. Put the bowl of custard in the fridge for 3-4 hours, preferably overnight, so it gets really cold.
6.	Get the ice cream machine running, scoop out the vanilla pod pieces, then slowly pour in the cold custard. Leave it to churn for 10-30 minutes (depending on your machine). When it stops, it is probably too soft to eat, so spoon into a plastic container, cover with cling film, then a lid, and freeze for a minimum of 3 hours. (It will keep in the freezer for 3 months but don’t take it out, then refreeze.) Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before serving.
7.	To make it by hand: in step 1, heat the milk, vanilla, and half the sugar without the cream (the custard will be slightly thicker). At the start of step 6, whip the cream so it’s light and floppy, not too stiff, and fold it into the cold custard. Freeze for 3-4 hours, stirring once an hour until almost frozen, then freeze as above.
