Roasted autumn vegetables with Lancashire cheese
Ingredients:
•	1 large butternut squash (about 600-700g/1lb 5oz - 1lb 9oz in weight)
•	1 medium red onion
•	6 tbsp olive oil
•	1 large sprig fresh sage
•	1 large courgette
•	1 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar
•	100g Lancashire cheese
Steps:
1.	Preheat the oven to fan180C/conventional 200C/ gas 6. Using a sharp knife, cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut the halves into smaller pieces so you can peel them more easily. Chop the flesh into big bite-sized pieces – they don’t have to be neat.
2.	Halve the onion and trim the root end leaving a little on to hold the segments together. Peel and then cut each half into four wedges. Scatter the squash and onion in a large roasting tin so they have plenty of room to roast, drizzle over 5 tbsp of the oil and toss together. Strip the sage leaves from the stem and roughly chop – you should have about 2 tbsps. Scatter over the vegetables and season. Roast for 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
3.	Meanwhile, slice the courgette thickly and toss with the remaining oil. Remove the roasting tin from the oven and push the partly cooked squash and onion to the side. Put the courgette slices flat on the base and season. Roast for a further 10 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender.
4.	Remove tin from the oven, sprinkle the vinegar over the vegetables and toss. Crumble over the Lancashire cheese. Toss lightly so the cheese melts a little and serve.

Toddler recipe: Batch-cook mini pork & veg balls
Ingredients:
For the meatballs
•	2 tsp rapeseed oil
•	1 small onion, chopped
•	1 slice wholemeal bread, torn into chunks
•	1 carrot, cut into chunks
•	1 celery stick, cut into chunks
•	1 red pepper, cut into chunks
•	500g lean pork mince
•	1 egg
For the sauce
•	1 tsp rapeseed oil
•	2 garlic cloves, crushed
•	2 x 390g cartons passata
•	1 tsp dried thyme
•	1 tsp sugar (optional)
•	fresh basil or parsley, chopped (optional)
•	cooked spaghetti and grated cheese, to serve
Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Heat 2 tsp rapeseed oil in a medium saucepan. Add the onion and cook for 5-10 mins until softened. Blitz the bread in a food processor until you have breadcrumbs. Add the cooked onion, carrot, celery and peppers and pulse until finely chopped. You may need to use a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl a few times. Add the pork, egg and a little black pepper, then pulse to combine.
2.	Divide the mixture in half. Shape half into small meatballs about the size of large marbles and arrange on a baking tray lined with foil. Shape the rest into golf-ball-sized meatballs. Arrange on a lined tray and open freeze. Once frozen, transfer to a freezer bag and save for another meal. Now bake the mini meatballs for 25 mins or until browned and cooked through.
3.	Meanwhile, make the sauce. Using the same pan that you cooked the onion in, heat the 1 tsp oil, add the garlic and cook for 2 mins. Pour in the passata, add the thyme and sugar. Simmer for 5-10 mins. Gently stir the meatballs and any juices into the sauce and heat through for a few mins. Stir the meatballs through the spaghetti and serve with grated cheese.
