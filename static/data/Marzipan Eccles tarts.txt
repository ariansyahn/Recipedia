Marzipan Eccles tarts
Ingredients:
•	300g leftover dried fruit, like raisins, sultanas, currants
•	2 eating apples or pears, cored and grated
•	50g demerara sugar, plus a little extra to decorate
•	100g leftover marzipan, grated
•	½ tsp ground cloves
•	1 tsp ground cinnamon
•	500g block puff pastry
•	little flour, for rolling
•	1 egg, beaten

Steps:
1.	Mix the dried fruit, grated apple or pear, Demerara sugar, marzipan, cloves and cinnamon.
2.	Divide the pastry into 6. Then assemble tarts one by one. Halve a chunk of pastry and roll out each halve to a circle about the thickness of a 50p piece on a floured surface. Spoon a sixth of the filling into the centre of one circle in a pile. Brush edges with egg, and lift the second pastry circle on top. Gently press down on the fruit to push out as much air as you can. Press the pastry edges to seal. Use an appropriate sized bowl, glass etc to help you trim the edges to a neat circle. At this stage, you can cover and chill the tarts overnight, or freeze for 1 month. Defrost before continuing. Brush with beaten egg, then make three small slashes with a knife in a row. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.
3.	Pop the tarts in the fridge while you heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. When the oven is nice and hot, brush tarts all over with egg and sprinkle each with a little more sugar. Bake for 20 - 25 mins, until golden, then eat warm with ice cream or custard.

British pork cassoulet
Ingredients:
•	400-450g streaky steaks (strips of pork belly ), rind trimmed
•	1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil
•	400-450g pack of pork sausages (try Cumberland, garlic or sage-flavoured Lincolnshire varieties)
•	4 back bacon chops, about 400g/14oz
•	400g can cannellini, haricot, butter or mixed beans, drained
•	1 large onion, chopped
•	4 medium carrots, thickly sliced
•	400g can chopped tomatoes
•	1 bouquet garni 'tea bag'
•	about 600ml chicken stock (from a stock cube is fine)
•	25g fresh white breadcrumbs
•	2 garlic cloves

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Quickly pan-fry the strips of pork belly in the oil, followed by the sausages and back bacon chops, until well browned.
2.	Mix together the beans, onion, garlic, carrots and tomatoes in a bowl. Starting with a spoonful of the veg, inter-layer the vegetable mix and meats in a deep braising pan (about 3 litres capacity, 7.5cm deep, preferably one that will go on top of the stove – see Gary’s tip, below). Place the bouquet garni in the centre as everything is being stacked.
3.	Pour just enough chicken stock on top to almost cover, then bring to a simmer on top of the stove (see Gary’s tip). Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top and braise in the oven for about 1hr 20- 1hr 30 mins, until the meats are all tender and the top is golden brown. If the stock reduces while braising, simply pour a little more on top to moisten. Remove from the oven and allow to settle for 5 mins before serving. (Remember to take out the bouquet garni.)

Split pea & green pea smoked ham soup
Ingredients:
•	1kg gammon or ham hock
•	200g split peas, soaked overnight
•	2 onions, roughly chopped
•	2 carrots, roughly chopped
•	2 bay leaves
•	1 stick celery, roughly chopped
•	300g frozen peas
•	crusty bread and butter, to serve

Steps:
1.	Put the gammon in a very large pan with 2 litres water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and drain off the water – this helps to get rid of some of the saltiness. Recover with 2 litres cold water and bring to the boil again. Put everything but the frozen peas into the pan and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1½-2½ hrs, topping up the water as and when you need to, to a similar level it started at. As the ham cooks and softens, you can halve it if you want, so it is all submerged under the liquid. When the ham is tender enough to pull into shreds, it is ready.
2.	Lift out the ham, peel off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a clean pair of rubber gloves), shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and stir in the frozen peas. Simmer for 1 min, then blend until smooth. Add a splash of water if too thick, and return to the pan to heat through if it has cooled, or if you are making ahead.
3.	When you are ready to serve, mix the hot soup with most of the ham – gently reheat if made ahead. Serve in bowls with the remaining ham scattered on top, and eat with crusty bread and butter.

Fish pie - in four steps
Ingredients:
•	400g skinless white fish fillet
•	400g skinless smoked haddock fillet
•	600ml full-fat milk
•	1 small onion, quartered
•	4 cloves
•	2 bay leaves
•	4 eggs
•	small bunch parsley, leaves only, chopped
•	100g butter
•	50g plain flour
•	pinch freshly grated nutmeg
•	1kg floury potato, peeled and cut into even-sized chunks
•	50g cheddar, grated

Steps:
1.	Poach 400g skinless white fish fillets and 400g skinless smoked haddock fillets. Put the fish in the frying pan and pour over 500ml of the full-fat milk. Quarter 1 small onion and stud each quarter with a clove, then add to the milk, with 2 bay leaves. Bring the milk just to the boil – you will see a few small bubbles. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 mins. Lift the fish onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug to cool. Flake the fish into large pieces in the baking dish.
2.	Hard-boil 4 eggs. Bring a small pan of water to a gentle boil, then carefully lower the eggs in with a slotted spoon. Bring the water back to a gentle boil, with just a couple of bubbles rising to the surface. Set the timer for 8 mins, cook, then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water. Peel, slice into quarters and arrange on top of the fish, then scatter over the chopped leaves of a small bunch of parsley.
3.	Make the sauce. Melt 50g butter in a pan, stir in 50g plain flour and cook for 1 min over moderate heat. Take off the heat, pour in a little of the cold poaching milk, then stir until blended. Continue to add the milk gradually, mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat, bring to the boil and cook for 5 mins, stirring continually, until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, then pour over the fish.
4.	Assemble and bake. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil 1kg floury potatoes, cut into even-sized chunks, for 20 mins. Drain, season and mash with the remaining 50g butter and 100ml full-fat milk. Use to top the pie, starting at the edge of the dish and working your way in – push the mash right to the edges to seal. Fluff the top with a fork, sprinkle over 50g grated cheddar, then bake for 30 mins. Make up to a day ahead, chill, then bake for 40 mins.
