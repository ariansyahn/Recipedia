Pork & pepper meatballs on parsnip mash
Ingredients:
•	¼ tsp cinnamon
•	1 tsp smoked paprika
•	1 red pepper, chopped
•	2 garlic cloves, crushed
•	1 tsp oregano
•	1 wholemeal pitta bread, torn into pieces
•	250g lean pork mince
•	1 egg, beaten
•	2 tsp olive oil
•	3 parsnips, peeled and chopped
•	140g passata
•	1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped

Steps:
1.	Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. In the small bowl of a food processor, put the cinnamon, half the paprika, the pepper, 1 garlic clove, the oregano and torn pitta. Blitz until very finely chopped, then tip into a large bowl and add the mince and the egg, and season well. Rub 1 tsp of the oil over a large baking sheet. Squish the pork and pepper mixture together with your hands, shape into 8 meatballs and place evenly spaced on the prepared baking sheet.
2.	Bake the meatballs for 20 mins or until cooked through and lightly golden. Meanwhile, cook the parsnips in a pan of boiling water over a high heat for 15 mins, then drain and mash with some seasoning, keeping warm until needed.
3.	For a quick tomato sauce, put the remaining crushed garlic and paprika in a small saucepan with the passata and cook over a medium heat for 5 mins, until thickened a little. To serve, divide the parsnip mash between the plates, tip the meatballs into the pan with the sauce and stir to coat them, then pile everything on top of the mash. Scatter over the parsley and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Serve immediately.

Meatball gravy sub
Ingredients:
•	1 tbsp olive oil
•	1 onion, ½ finely chopped, ½ sliced
•	1 garlic clove, crushed
•	250g pack beef mince
•	½ tbsp balsamic vinegar
•	100ml beef stock
•	1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
•	1 large ciabatta roll
•	2 slices mature cheddar
•	mixed leaves, to serve (optional)

Steps:
1.	Heat half the oil in a frying pan and add the finely chopped onion. Cook until softened and slightly browned, about 10 mins. Add the garlic and stir for 1 min. Set aside to cool a little. Put the mince in a large bowl and tip in the cooked onion and garlic. Season generously and mix together with your hands.
2.	Roll the mince into eight meatballs, then freeze half for another meal, if you like (defrost in the fridge before cooking). Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. In the same pan, fry the meatballs with the remaining oil for 1-2 mins until browned.
3.	Transfer the meatballs to a roasting tin with the sliced onion, balsamic vinegar, stock and Worcestershire sauce. Bake for 20 mins until the meatballs are cooked and the onions are tender. Halve the ciabatta and bake for 2 mins to warm through.
4.	Pour some of the gravy and onions onto one side of the ciabatta, add the meatballs and layer over the cheese. Add more onion gravy to melt the cheese. Serve with mixed leaves, if you like.
