Scampi with tartare sauce
Ingredients:
•	15-20 langoustine or Dublin Bay prawn tails
•	vegetable or sunflower oil, for frying
•	140g plain flour
•	85g cornflour
•	150ml beer
•	100ml sparkling water
•	lemon wedges and chips, to serve
For the tartare sauce
•	6 tbsp mayonnaise
•	1 gherkin or 6 cornichons, finely chopped
•	1 tbsp caper, rinsed and chopped
•	1 tsp lemon juice
•	1 tbsp chopped parsley
•	2 tsp chopped tarragon

Steps:
1.	To prepare the langoustines, pull off the head and pincers. Lay the tail flat on a chopping board and use a sharp pair of scissors to cut a line straight down the back of the shell. Carefully peel the langoustine, score down the back, then remove the grit sac.
2.	Get the oil heating in a large saucepan or wok – you will need enough to come 2-3in up the side of the pan. For the tartare sauce, mix all ingredients in a bowl and season.
3.	Place the flours in a bowl with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Add the beer and sparkling water, and whisk to a smooth batter.
4.	To test if the oil is hot enough, put a drop of batter into the pan – it should crisp and brown within 30 secs. Dip each langoustine or prawn tail into the batter, then carefully drop it into the oil. Drizzle a little extra batter over each one while they are cooking – this will give you a really crispy coating. Cook them in batches, making sure you don’t overcrowd the pan. When golden and floating to the surface, scoop out and drain well on kitchen paper. Sprinkle the scampi with salt and serve with the tartare sauce, lemon wedges and chips.

Beef, ale & parsnip pudding
Ingredients:
•	1 large onion, chopped
•	100g smoked bacon lardons
•	2 tbsp olive oil
•	500g lean stewing beef, cubed
•	2 tbsp plain flour
•	3 parsnips, cubed
•	500ml brown ale
•	300ml beef stock
•	2 tbsp cranberry or redcurrant jelly
•	4 thyme sprigs
•	greens, to serve (optional)
For the suet pastry
•	butter, for greasing
•	300g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
•	2 tsp English mustard powder
•	140g shredded suet

Steps:
1.	Heat a large pan and cook the onion and lardons together for 5 mins until golden. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the oil to the pan, dust the beef with the flour, then evenly brown over a high heat.
2.	Add the parsnips, ale, stock, jelly, thyme and lardon mixture to the pan. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 1½ hrs until the meat is tender.
3.	Generously butter a 1.5-litre pudding basin. To make the pastry, mix together the flour, mustard powder, suet and ½ tsp table salt. Add enough cold water, about 150ml, to make a soft dough. Remove one-quarter of the dough and set to one side. On a heavily floured surface, roll out the remaining dough to make a large round, big enough to line the basin.
4.	Carefully lay the pastry in the basin (aim to have 1cm of pastry overhanging the rim), then press the edges of the join together to seal. Roll out the remaining one-quarter into a circle big enough to cover the top.
5.	Pour off the cooking liquid from the filling into a small pan and set aside. Discard the thyme stalks. Spoon the filling into the lined basin and pour over 100ml of the cooking liquid. Fold over the overhanging pastry and brush with water. Place the lid on top, pressing firmly around the edges to seal.
6.	Butter a sheet of baking parchment, fold in a large pleat and lay, butter-side down, on top of the pudding. Cover with a pleated layer of foil and finally tie with string, making a loop for the handle so you can lift the pudding easily.
7.	Sit a small trivet or a large cookie cutter in the bottom of a deep saucepan that’s big enough to take the basin easily. Half-fill the pan with water and bring to the boil. Lower in the pudding, cover and simmer for 2 hrs, topping up with boiling water when necessary.
8.	Reheat the cooking liquid, bubbling it down a little so it reduces into a tasty gravy. Carefully lift out the pudding. Run a knife around the rim, then turn out and serve with gravy and greens, if you like.

Baked Fish and Chips
Ingredients:
For the Chips:
•	3 medium russet potatoes (1 1/4 pounds)
•	1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
•	Pinch of cayenne pepper
•	Kosher salt
For the Fish:
•	Olive oil cooking spray
•	2 3/4 cups crispy rice cereal
•	Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
•	3 large egg whites
•	1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless Pollock (or other firm white fish), cut into 2-by-4-inch pieces
•	Tartar sauce and/or malt vinegar, for serving (optional)

Steps:
1.	Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F using the convection setting, if available. Place a baking sheet on one of the racks to preheat.
2.	Prepare the chips: Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick sticks. Toss with the olive oil and cayenne in a bowl. Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven, add the potatoes and spread in an even layer. Use a rubber spatula to scrape any oil from the bowl over the potatoes. Bake on the top oven rack, turning once, until browned and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Season with salt.
3.	Meanwhile, make the fish: Set a wire rack on a baking sheet and coat with cooking spray. Lightly crush the cereal in a bowl with your fingers. Add 2 teaspoons salt, and black pepper to taste. In another bowl, whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt until frothy.
4.	Dip the fish in the egg whites, then roll in the cereal crumbs to coat. Place the fish pieces on the rack (position them on their sides so that the majority of the crust is exposed) and mist with cooking spray.
5.	Bake the fish on the bottom oven rack until crisp and just cooked through, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve the fish and chips with tartar sauce and/or malt vinegar, if desired.

No-fail Yorkies
Ingredients:
•	450ml milk
•	4 large eggs
•	250g plain flour
•	2 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil

Steps:
1.	Up to 3-4 hrs before cooking, mix together the milk, eggs, flour and 2 tsp salt in a food processor or blender until you have a smooth batter. If you don’t have a food processor or blender, whisk the eggs into the flour and salt, then gradually whisk in the milk until smooth. Transfer to a jug, cover and leave at room temperature for at least 15 mins.
2.	Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and brush 12 holes of a muffin tin with the oil. Heat the tin in the oven for 5 mins, then carefully lift out and quickly pour the batter into the holes. Bake in the oven for 5 mins, then reduce oven temperature to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and cook for a further 30 mins until puffed, risen and golden.
