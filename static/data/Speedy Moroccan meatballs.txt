•	400g tin chopped tomato with garlic
•	25g toasted flaked almond
•	handful coriander, roughly chopped	
Steps:

Club Tropicana ice cream cake	
Ingredients:
•	1 madeira cake (we used one from M&S that comes in a large rectangular block)
•	500ml tub mango sorbet
•	500ml tub vanilla ice cream
•	50g dark chocolate
•	500ml tub raspberry sorbet
•	150ml double cream, whipped
•	maraschino cherries, to decorate	
Steps:
1.	Cut a piece of sponge about 5mm thick to fit a 1lb 16 x 10cm loaf tin and trim off any dark edges (off-cuts are a cook's perk). Line the loaf tin with a double layer of strong cling film and push the sponge into the base. If the madeira cake is smaller than the tin, patch any gaps – you won’t see them when the cake is finished.
2.	Spoon a layer of mango sorbet into the tin using three-quarters of the tub, flatten the surface using the back of a spoon and freeze for 10 mins. Repeat using the vanilla ice cream, then add another layer of sponge. Melt the chocolate and pour it over the second layer of sponge. Freeze for 10 mins, then carefully add a layer of raspberry sorbet in the same way, followed by a final layer of sponge. Cover the lot in cling film, then freeze until you need it. Turn the ice cream cake out of the tin onto a plate and peel off the cling film, then decorate the top with whipped cream and cherries. Wait 10 mins before slicing with a long, straight-edged knife. Extra cherries are optional.



Raspberry ripple ice cream	
Ingredients:
•	250g raspberry, plus extra to serve, if you like
•	225g caster sugar
•	2 large eggs, plus 4 egg yolks
•	600ml double cream
•	sliced mango, sprinkles, or cones, to serve	
Steps:
1.	Place the raspberries and 2 tbsp of the sugar in a small pan. Cook on a medium heat until sugar dissolves. Simmer for 5 mins until thickened, then push through a sieve into a bowl and discard the seeds left in the sieve.
2.	Place the eggs, egg yolks and remaining sugar in a bowl. Whisk with an electric whisk to combine, then place over a pan of gently simmering water – make sure the bowl isn’t actually touching the water. Beat with the electric whisk for 3-4 mins until thick and pale. Remove from heat and continue beating until cool.
3.	In another bowl, whisk the cream until it forms soft peaks, then gently fold into the cool egg mix until just combined. Pour the mix into a shallow container or dish that can be frozen.
4.	Gently swirl the raspberry coulis through, cover with cling film and freeze for at least 6 hrs. Serve scoops in bowls with sliced mango and extra raspberries, or scoop into cones and top with sprinkles for the kids.


Coconut, caramel & pecan dairy-free ice cream	
Ingredients:
•	2 x 400ml cans full-fat coconut milk
•	3 egg yolks
•	4 tbsp coconut sugar, or caster sugar
•	dash vanilla extract
•	50g pecans, toasted and roughly chopped	
Steps:
1.	Whisk the coconut milk until smooth. Measure 600ml into a saucepan and heat until just steaming. Meanwhile whisk the egg yolks with 3 tbsp sugar and the vanilla. Slowly pour the hot milk onto the yolks, whisking constantly. Wipe the pan clean, pour in the coconut and egg mixture, then cook over a medium heat, stirring for 5-6 mins until you have a thin custard. Strain and leave to cool completely, then churn in an ice cream maker.
2.	To make the caramel, put the remaining coconut milk and sugar in a saucepan with a pinch of salt. Boil for 3 mins until it has the consistency of double cream. Cool, then swirl the caramel and pecans through the ice cream mix, cover the surface with cling film and freeze.



Easy strawberry ice cream	
Ingredients:
•	1 x 400g punnet strawberries
•	1 x 250g tub mascarpone
•	½ x 397g can condensed milk
•	cones and sprinkles, to serve	
Steps:
1.	Pull the green hulls out of the strawberries. If they are still quite hard, cut them in half or quarters with a table knife. Tip them into a flat-bottomed dish.
2.	Use a potato masher to squash the strawberries as much as you can. Tip into a bowl. Ask your grown-up helper to give you a hand if you need to.
3.	Add the mascarpone and mash this in – don’t worry if it is a bit lumpy. Add the condensed milk and mix everything together. Don’t worry if the mix is streaky.
4.	Spoon the mixture into a metal or plastic box and put it in the freezer. Wait until the next day or at least 6 hours before scooping into bowls or cones. Decorate how you like.
