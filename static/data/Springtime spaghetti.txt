Steps:
1.	Finely chop the garlic. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the onion, stirring frequently, for 8 mins. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and cook for 2 mins more. Meanwhile, put the beans in a bowl with the egg, tomato purée and spices, and mash until smooth.

Venison meatball & wild mushroom stroganoff
Ingredients:
•	1 onion, finely chopped
•	2 garlic cloves, crushed
•	2 tbsp sunflower oil
•	small bunch dill, roughly chopped plus 1 tbsp finely chopped
•	2 tbsp wholegrain mustard
•	400g venison mince
•	100g fresh white breadcrumbs
•	1 medium egg, beaten
•	25g butter
•	400g wild mushrooms, larger ones sliced
•	½ tsp smoked paprika
•	1 tbsp plain flour
•	400g beef stock
•	150ml brandy
•	2 tsp Dijon mustard
•	1 tbsp tomato purée
•	300ml pot soured cream
•	pinch of sugar  (optional)
•	buttered tagliatelle, rice or sautéed potatoes, to serve

Steps:
1.	Gently cook the onion and garlic in 1 tbsp oil until really soft. Cool for 10 mins, then tip into a big bowl with the finely chopped dill, 1 tbsp of the wholegrain mustard, the venison, breadcrumbs and egg with 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp ground black pepper. Squelch together with your hands, squeezing the mince well to tenderise it as you mix.
2.	Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan or sauté pan and fry the meatballs in small batches until well browned – add a splash more oil if needed towards the end. Set aside the meatballs in a dish.
3.	Add the butter to the pan and fry the mushrooms over a very high heat until the juices have evaporated and the mushrooms are turning golden. Lower the heat and stir in the paprika and flour for 1 min.
4.	Stir in the stock and brandy, and bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits stuck in the pan. Lift out the mushrooms with a slotted spoon to a dish. Boil the sauce for 3 mins, then stir in the remaining 1 tbsp wholegrain mustard, the Dijon mustard, tomato purée and soured cream. Simmer the sauce until it has reduced again and is a good consistency – anything up to 15 mins depending on your pan. Return the meatballs and any juice and simmer gently until they are cooked through. Stir in the mushrooms to warm through, and season to taste, plus a pinch of sugar if needed. Scatter with the remaining dill and eat with buttered tagliatelle, rice or sautéed potatoes.

Cooking with kids: Spaghetti & meatballs with hidden veg sauce
Ingredients:
For the meatballs
•	300g good quality pork sausage (about 4 large or 8 chipolatas)
•	500g lean beef mince
•	1 small onion, coarsely grated
•	1 carrot, finely grated
•	1 tbsp dried oregano
•	50g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve
•	1 medium egg
•	1 tbsp olive oil
For the tomato sauce
•	1 tbsp olive oil
•	1 courgette, coarsely grated
•	3 garlic cloves, finely grated
•	1 tbsp tomato purée
•	pinch caster sugar
•	splash red wine vinegar
•	2x 400g tins chopped tomato
To serve
•	cooked spaghetti

Steps:
1.	Children: Squeeze all the sausage meat out of the sausage skins into a large bowl and add the mince. Tip all the rest of the meatball ingredients, except the olive oil, into the bowl and season with black pepper then squish everything together through your hands until completely mixed. Keep an eye on younger children to make sure they don’t taste any of the raw mix.
2.	Children: Roll the meatball mix into walnut-sized balls and place them on a plate – this is a job children as young as 2 can help with and a great job to help teach older children basic division.
3.	Grown ups: While the children are rolling the meatballs make the sauce. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the courgette and garlic and cook for 5 mins until soft and mushy. Stir in the tomato puree, sugar and vinegar leave for 1 min then tip in the tomatoes and simmer for 5 mins. If your children like courgettes then you can leave the sauce chunky. But if, like mine, they hate courgettes then blitz the sauce with a hand blender – either way continue to simmer sauce gently while you cook the meatballs. If your child is confident with heat, from 7+ they can cook the sauce with supervision.
4.	Grown ups: Heat the oil in a large frying pan and, working in batches, brown the meatballs on all sides then pop them into the sauce – continue to simmer the sauce for 15 mins, stirring very gently until the meatballs are cooked through. Serve with cooked spaghetti, extra grated Parmesan and a few torn basil leaves your child has picked and torn.
